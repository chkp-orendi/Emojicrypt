It provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently, taking care of scaling and failover for applications, providing deployment patterns, and more. Kubernetes clusters consist of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. The control plane manages the nodes and the workloads running on them.\n\nQuestion: What are the primary functions of the control plane in a Kubernetes cluster?"

It translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. DNS is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet, as it provides a way to match domain names (like www.example.com) to their corresponding IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1). The DNS system is maintained by a distributed database and relies on a network of DNS servers to resolve queries.\n\nQuestion: What is the primary function of the Domain Name System (DNS) in the context of the Internet?"
