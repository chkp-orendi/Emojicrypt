Example:
Alligators are powerful reptiles commonly found in freshwater habitats such as swamps, rivers, and lakes in the southeastern United States. These ancient creatures have been around for millions of years, surviving through various environmental changes. Alligators are apex predators, meaning they sit at the top of the food chain, feeding on a variety of animals, including fish, birds, and small mammals. Despite their fearsome reputation, alligators are generally shy and avoid human contact unless provoked or threatened.
What is the role of alligators in their ecosystem, and how do they typically interact with humans?
