- Database of alot of querries to llms. might be good place to check prompt distance


github presidio


Run and play with presidio

Check if we get key for azurue ai and start playing with Ada2/Ada3

recheck what kind of prompt oren want.
Do we want to get encryption chart or the new text.


continue writing tests, look for good data for it and ask oren to help to look for data and give concrete examples.
ask yoni and oren if maybe we should make our own data base. generate random tables and random questions and send them to llm


make presidio work (maybe work from home)


need to write encryption test
add difference from original answer



choose embedding testing data - checkpoint users prompt seems the best chose
how to decide what is a good embedding result - use bertscore and get >0.85
how to know if encryption was good enough - 
        embed all the text and check distance or check key:value for each (need to try and encrypt that way)


talk with Yoni and Oren about problems with the encryption test we talked about
