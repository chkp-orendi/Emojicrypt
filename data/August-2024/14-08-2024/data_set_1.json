These scandals resulted in a decline of public trust in accounting and reporting practices. SOX established new or expanded requirements for all U.S. public company boards, management, and public accounting firms. The act contains 11 titles, or sections, ranging from additional corporate board responsibilities to criminal penalties, and requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement rulings on requirements to comply with the law.
