There were many Portuguese associations in the city, representing immigrants from specific regions of Portugal, and the original idea of the founders was to bring these organizations under one roof. The foundation of the Casa de Portugal saw representatives of Uni\u00e3o Transmontana, Casa do Minho, Uni\u00e3o Portuguesa, Centro Beir\u00e3o and Centro do Douro. Other organizations were subsequently invited, but preferred to maintain their regional character and refused. The first president was the philologist Francisco da Luz Rebelo Gon\u00e7alves, a professor at the newly founded University of S\u00e3o Paulo, but he remained in office for only 10 months and was succeeded for the interim by Aur\u00e9lio Martins Arrobas and in 1936 by Fernando Ribeiro Bacellar.\n\nInitially the Casa de Portugal worked at the headquarters of the Casa do Minho and then in rented properties. Through donations from members and bank loans land and buildings were purchased on the Avenida da Liberdade, in the city center in 1943. The inauguration of the headquarters took place on December 27, 1955.\n\nFeatures \nThe headquarters of the Casa de Portugal is a neocolonial building of five floors designed by Portuguese architect Ricardo Severo. The lobby is decorated with paintings depicting Afonso I, the first king of Portugal, and Manuel da Nobrega, a Portuguese Jesuit priest very influential in the early History of Brazil, and who participated in the founding of several cities, such as Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, and many Jesuit Colleges and seminaries. The building also has meeting rooms, a restaurant, theater, gallery exhibition and a ballroom with a capacity for 1,000 people.\n\nThe Casa de Portugal also serves as headquarters for the Council of the Luso-Brazilian Community of S\u00e3o Paulo, the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and the Ombudsman of the Portuguese Community. It was also headquarters for the Consulate of Portugal in S\u00e3o Paulo and the Cam\u00f5es Institute, but these institutions have moved to a building in the Jardim Am\u00e9rica area in 2004.\n\nLibrary \nThe creation of a library for the Casa de Portugal had been planned since its foundation, when the partners began to donate books to the collection. In 1957 the library was opened, and in 1991 it was extended with an auditorium and reading room. Currently it has 12,000 volumes, of which almost half are dedicated to history and Luso-Brazilian literature.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n Facebook page of Casa de Portugal\n\nPortuguese emigrants to Brazil\nPortuguese diaspora\nOrganisations based in S\u00e3o Paulo\n1935 establishments in Brazil",

It is the 87th film in ESPN's 30 for 30 series. The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nBackground \nIn 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58\u20137. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.\n\nThe rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.\n\nThe documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.\n\nCast \nCreadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall. The film also features interviews with head coaches Lou Holtz and Jimmy Johnson; Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez; Notre Dame players Chris Zorich, Pat Eilers, Pat Terrell, and Todd Lyght, among others; and Miami players Steve Walsh, Cleveland Gary, and Leon Searcy, among others.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson called Catholics vs. Convicts a \"gripping gridiron drama.\" Sporting News ranks the film \"among the best\" of the 30 for 30 franchise.\n\nReferences \n\nNotre Dame vs. Miami\nMiami Hurricanes football\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish football\n30 for 30\n2016 television films",

The artist's most popular motive was the Scottish highlands. Joel was a much respected artist during the Victorian and Edwardian era, valued especially for the vibrancy of his palette and 'flowing', 'sophisticated' brush strokes, yet was largely forgotten (and underestimated) in the late 20th and early 21st century.

Early examples of his paintings (during the 1890s) are usually dated, which is not the case for his later works.\n\nJoel is part of the 'late romantic movement', aimed at supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values. Bates will have been inspired by the likes of Turner and Constable, adding a 'contemporary, Victorian, perspective' to traditional imagery. Paintings such as 'Loch Lomod' are typical for Bates Joel's style; \"refined and vibrant yet with strongly romanticised aura.\" Henry Bates Joel's primary medium of painting was oil but many watercolours exist as well.\n\nJoel also painted the Isle of Wight, some of his paintings (such as 'Bonchurch, near Ventnor, Isle of Wight', which shows an impressionist influence) are exhibited in Milntown Estate.

County Market, which replaced National Supermarket, was also expanded.\n\nHobby Lobby, Steve & Barry's, and Goody's all closed in 2008, the latter two due to bankruptcy of the chains.

By 2010, the last restaurant had closed in the food court. Elder-Beerman was re-branded Carson's in 2011, and Dunham's Sports filled the rest of the former Hobby Lobby.

It does not have a ticket agent, but the station does have personnel that can assist riders upon departure and arrival. The station is directly across the tracks from the National New York Central Railroad Museum.\n\nHistory \nElkhart station was originally built in 1900 by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and had a freight house installed across the tracks in 1907. The building is constructed of red brick trimmed with limestone, which is used for the window surrounds and belt course. The station was originally set amid a well-kept garden that displayed neat beds of colorful flowers and a row of trees along the tracks; this manicured landscape was not only a pretty introduction to the city for first time visitors, but it also buffered the streets of downtown from the noise and dirt associated with steam engines and freight trains. The station and the railroad were acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1914. NYC merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, and passenger service was taken over by Amtrak in 1971. The freight house became the National NYC Museum in 1987.\n\nTransit connections \n\nMACOG Interurban Trolley's Elkhart-Goshen and Concord routes both stop near the station.

It is a follow up to 2013's Hubardo. It's the first album from Kayo Dot to not be self-released since 2012's Gamma Knife. Coffins on Io marks a notable change in sound. It combines influences of Type O Negative, The Sisters of Mercy, Peter Gabriel, dark wave and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of electronic music, jazz fusion, post-punk, gothic rock and new wave.  It was produced by Toby Driver.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on The Flenser for one of Driver's other bands, Vaura, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album. Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDriver has said that the album was influenced by dark wave as well as Type O Negative, Peter Gabriel and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by dark wave and was written as evoking \"1980s retrofuture noir.\"\n\nDriver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of Hubardo resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior Kayo Dot albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior Kayo Dot albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically Blade Runner.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through The Flenser. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in MP3, FLAC, CD and LP. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction. Empty Lighthouse called it \"Kayo Dot's best album to date\" and celebrates its ability to \"nail the noir feel,\" describing the album as \"Lynchian\". Re-views Media writer Michael Snoxall gave the album four stars out of five, saying the album feels familiar yet alien at the same time, and that the album is a \"monumental\" and \"towering achievement.\" SputnikMusic gave it a 4/5, saying it \"hums with sleek resonance\" and calling the album \"vibrant and exciting.\"\n\nTrack listing\nMusic by Toby Driver.

The song's title \"Nero\" and \"Forte\" are Italian words that mean \"black\" and \"strong\" respectively. \"Forte\" can also mean something in which you excel.\n\nRecording and meaning  \nThough the song title does not appear in the lyrics, it describes the darkness that Taylor sunk into. The depression was like an entity that he did not feel he had the strength to fight against. When talking about the song, guitarist\u00a0Jim Root stated: \"This is also a\u00a0Clown song, which is amazing. This one is going to be great live. It's very percussive and reminiscent of\u00a0\"Psychosocial\", but maybe an evolution of \"Psychosocial\". Obviously, Clown is a drummer and percussionist, but he's also a songwriter\u2014and he always has been. Now we're able to collaborate as songwriters, and this is what we end up with. When Corey came in and started diving into the vocals, he came up with this extra melody in the chorus line, very late into the process. That really drew me into this song.\"\n\nMusic video  \nShawn Crahan, Slipknot's percussionist and founder, directed the video along with a 20 minute short film titled Pollution, which would be released on the same day as the \"Nero Forte\". They were both recorded within two days, on both the 29th and 30 October. They were both initially to be released at some point during November, but for some reasons they did not come into fruition until a later date.\n\nThe \"Nero Forte\" music video stars the band, who jam out and perform in a white limbo, constantly flashed by coloured beaming lights, at points surrounding what seems to be a fan inside of a cocoon, which has something inside which appears to try to be trying to escape and be reborn.\n\nAs of December 2021, the song has 40 million views on YouTube.\n\nCharts\n\nReferences \n\nSongs written by Corey Taylor\nSongs written by Jim Root\nSongs written by Shawn Crahan\n2019 songs\n2019 singles\nSlipknot (band) songs\nRoadrunner Records singles",

This receptor is a protein dimer of two identical subunits, linked together by two pairs of disulfide bonds.\nIts molecular mass 190,000 Dalton.\n\nBlood testing of the soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is used as a measure of functional iron status and the investigation of iron deficiency anemia. Ferritin, a routine investigation for anemia, is an acute-phase reactant, and may be elevated in states of inflammation, thereby falsely indicating that iron stores are adequate. Because sTfR is insensitive to inflammation, it can detect anemia in patients with preexisting inflammatory states, and is particularly useful in distinguishing between the anemia of chronic disease and anemias caused by lack of iron intake.\n\nTo date, the conventionally identified soluble transferrin receptor has not been itself implicated in intracellular delivery of transferrin and associated iron stores.\n\nA soluble receptor for any ligand could also refer to a molecule present is solution (for example a secretory protein) which would bind with the target ligand and then  effect cellular delivery.

It became commonly known as the Fortress of Hunger (Fortaleza del hambre). The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island. Charles III of Spain, who was concerned for the plight of the islanders, ordered that the fortress be built.\n \nSituated on a cliff above the Port of Naos, the D shaped fort has semi-circular walls facing the sea. On the landward side, the rear wall is protected by two small turrets, with a moat crossed by a lifting drawbridge leading to the main gateway.

        "original_prompt": "summerize the following text in two sentences:\nAutopharmacology relates to the scientific study of the regulation of body functions by the activity of its naturally existent (or endogenous) chemical factors of the tissues. A more restricted definition would consider substances that were first identified as external agents which had a documented action on physiological functions, but later were discovered as existing as endogenous factors. The best example is the class of endorphins, which, as its name implies, were discovered to exist in the brain and have specific receptors in it, by investigations on the mechanism of action of opioids, such as morphine.\n\nHistorically, the first approach to the concept of autopharmacology began with British physiologist and pharmacologist Henry Dale in the 1910s, discovered the role of acetylcholine in synaptic transmission, and later proved by Austrian physiologist Otto Loewi, to be the neurotransmitter involved in the proximal synapses of the autonomic nervous system (initially named Vagusstoff by Loewi, and later identified as acetylcholine). The same happened to another autonomic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (Akzeleransstoff by Loewi), which later proved to be chemically similar to a long used pharmacological agent, adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. Both scientists were awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their pioneering and important contributions.\n\nA research area where autopharmacology principles assumed great importance was that of pain and inflammation, due to the great number of endogenous messengers, transmitters and modulators involved in their complex response at molecular and cellular level. The control and regulation mechanisms of the circulatory system and renal functions and their interactions (such as the renin/angiotensin system) are also greatly influenced by autopharmacological agents; One of the autopharmacology pioneers was Professor Mauricio Rocha e Silva, leader of the team of Brazilian researchers who discovered bradykinin in 1948, an endogenous substance involved in hypotension in circulatory shock. Of course, all these systems are of extreme importance for clinical practice and for the discovery of new therapeutic drugs.\n\nEndogenous substances that could fall under the concept of autopharmacology are:\n\n Endorphins\n Dynorphin\n Bradykinin\n Prostaglandins\n Angiotensin\n Secretin\n Gastrin\n Cholecystokinin\n Histamine\n Cannabinoids\n Substance P\n\nThe main scientific criterion for an autopharmacological agent is the discovery of specific membrane receptors for it and, hopefully, its transduction and cell signaling mechanisms.\n\nThe term was never much of a mainstream concept, and has fallen into disuse, as research on basic mechanisms has advanced. In a recent literature search on PubMed, only six titles refer to the term autopharmacology.\n\nReferences\n\nPharmacology\nPhysiology",

This late-1950s to 1960s period was when North Korea had first declared autonomous diplomacy.\n\nDuring the Somali Democratic Republic, relations with North Korea were close, due to shared ideals and geopolitical interests. Both countries formally adhered to anti-imperialism and Marxism\u2013Leninism, and were aligned with the Soviet Union in the context of the wider Cold War.

He then met with Kim Il-sung, and signed a bilateral agreement of technical and economic assistance.\n\nOver the following years, military cooperation intensified, with North Korea training and equipping the Somali Armed Forces.

The crypt contains the remains of a fifth-century Roman basilica. The site was originally occupied by a Roman fort.\n\nA new church was built on the site in early in 717 by Duke Adalbert of Alsace, brother of Saint Odile, as part of a new convent, in which he installed his daughter Attala as the first abbess.\n\nThe Church also served for many years as the episcopal seat for the north of Alsace.\n\nThe church was rebuilt in 1220 in Romanesque-Gothic style.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, St Stephen's was a parish church, the parish of Stephen's being one of the nine parishes of Strasbourg. In 1534, as the reform was being introduced in Strasbourg, the parish of St Stephen's was transferred to St William's, on account of the opposition of the cannonesses of St Stephen's to the new teaching.\n\nIn the seventeenth century Louis XIV closed the abbey and transferred it to the Visitandines to serve as a boarding school for young women, a function which continued up until the French Revolution. In 1714 the church was equipped with an organ by Andreas Silbermann, which is now in Bischheim. After the French Revolution, the building was used as a warehouse, then as a theatre. In 1802, the church was deprived of its tower and in 1805 this was transformed into a theatre.\n\nThe college, of which the church now forms part, began life in 1861 as a 'Petit seminaire' (literally 'little seminary'), educating future priests as well as lay students.\n\nAllied bombing destroyed much of the building in 1944. Only the wide transept with its triple apse survived. In 1956, the ancient site was excavated and a Merovingian apse was discovered beneath the foundations of the old tower. In 1961, the nave was renovated, exposing the timber structures. The church was classified as a historical monument in 1962.\n\nIn 2016, the monumental concert organ from the former conservatory located in the National Theatre of Strasbourg was moved into the nave in order to be used as a church organ. The instrument, a 1963 work by organ builder Curt Schwenkedel, had been out of use since 1995. It was entirely restored by Quentin Blumenroeder from Haguenau.\n\nAs the Church is now part of a school, public access is only possible on special occasions, such as European Heritage Days. The school owns some valuable historical tapestries from the abbey church, some of which can be seen in the nearby Notre Dame museum.\n\nExternal links \n\n Eglise Saint Etienne - 2 rue de la Pierre Large on archi-wiki.org \n website of the Saint-Etienne college\n Aerial photo on French historical monuments website\n\nReferences\n\nRoman Catholic churches in Strasbourg\nRoman Catholic chapels in France\nRoman sites in France\nRomanesque architecture in France\nMonuments historiques of Bas-Rhin",

Shah Jahan became so fond of the fort that it was here, in Shahi Qila that he establishes his court for the first three years of his ascending the throne.

As galbijjim is usually made from only the center part of ribs from a calf while the rib ends used to make soup stock, galbi was more expensive than other cuts of beef in South Korea, and has been regarded as a high-class dish.\n\nPreparation and serving\nRibs are cut to size and excess blood should be removed. Knife cuts are made in the meat till the bone to allow seasoning to seep in. Surplus fat is removed from the ribs, either by cutting or removing after parboiling. Soy sauce, sesame oil, scallions, minced garlic, pepper, ground sesame with salt (\uae68\uc18c\uae08), ginger juice, and sugar are mixed together with the ribs and are simmered in a large pot on a mid-flame. The cooking is done slowly, occasionally stirring. When the meat is almost cooked, additional seasoning is added with jujube,  ginkgo nuts, carrots, and pine nuts, and is boiled once again. Chestnuts, shiitake, and seogi mushrooms are added near the end of the dish.\nGalbijjim is usually served in a bowl rather than a plate and was traditionally served in a hap (\ud569, bowl with cover).\n\nGalbijjim by region\nThere is a galbijjim street in the district of Dongin-dong, Daegu, in South Korea. It is known as the original home of hot and spicy galbijjim (\ub9e4\uc6b4\uac08\ube44\ucc1c), as a restaurant owner served the first plate of hot and spicy galbijjim as anju for makgeolli in 1972.

Although never proven, she may have operated a white slave house along the river near Kew, from which women were abducted and smuggled to foreign countries (see Sexual slavery and Human trafficking).\n\nIn 1884, the Alfred Dyer's London Committee obtained evidence of a high class Chelsea brothel operated by Jeffries. An investigation by a former police inspector, who had resigned from the Metropolitan Police when senior officials refused to prosecute her, had been amassing evidence against Jeffries during the year until the London Commission began a private prosecution in March 1885.\n\nAlthough unable to charge Jeffries with any serious offence apart from keeping a disorderly house, the Commission expected much publicity from the case when presenting their evidence. For example, a former housemaid testified that she witnessed an assault on a 13-year-old girl who had been whipped by a belt and raped by a customer.\n\nAppearing in court on May 5, accompanied by several wealthy army officers, Jeffries paid a fine of \u00a3200 after arranging with the court to plead guilty in order to have the evidence against her remain undisclosed. As she left the courthouse, a guard of honour was formed around her by her young escorts.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nMary Jeffries at Probert Encyclopedia\n\n1820 births\n1907 deaths\nEnglish brothel owners and madams\nEnglish criminals\nBDSM people\n19th-century English businesspeople\n19th-century English businesswomen",

It is the second-most heavily populated district on the island and is located on its northwestern coast.\n\nDescription\nTerrain in the district is quite varied with steep ridges and a limited amount of flat ground, as befits the island's volcanic origin. It is mainly rural and lacks any main settlement as there are many small villages dispersed throughout. Its population has fluctuated from 795 in 1998 to 908 in 2008 and 843 in 2016. It trails only Half Tree Hollow District in size.\n\nThe district is named after the Anglican St Paul's Cathedral, which is located there, and also within the district is Plantation House, the Governor's official residence. The island's only secondary school is situated in St Paul's \u2014 the Prince Andrew School.\n\nHistory\nWhen the Dutch East India Company occupied St Helena in December 1672, they made their first landing attempt at Lemon Valley Bay, but were beaten off with boulders and rocks thrown by the defenders from the heights on the sides of the valley. After the English recaptured it in May 1673, the mouth of the Lemon Valley was quickly fortified to better deter any future attempts. By 1717 the fort there was ruinous and a quarantine station was built further up the valley to house the slaves recently received from Madagascar that had smallpox. The fortification in Lemon Valley were allowed to continue to deteriorate until they were replaced by entirely new buildings 50-odd years later.\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nDistricts of Saint Helena\nPopulated places in Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha",
