Tornike Chaduneli, the former Torpedo Kutaisi defender and Sarti manager, took charge of the team.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season was suspended until August, when a single-round competition between 14 clubs of Group D East began.\n\nBeing debutants in the Georgian league, the club from the very outset displayed an attacking football which greatly contributed to thrashing some rivals. By mid-season with the seven matches behind Shturmi had won five of them with a large margin and reached an astonishing 31:5 aggregate goal difference.\n\nIn mid-October the team was placed in a two-week COVID quarantine. Straight after the games were resumed, Shturmi set their own record by winning 12–0. Until the final game week the club kept beating all other opponents, although so did Dinamo-2 Tbilisi who, apart from the same winning run, had a better goal advantage. The decisive tie was supposed to determine a winner of the league group with promotion to Liga 4.\n\nThe match on 20 December in Sartichala drew a great interest among the cheering locals who, unable to get inside the ground, gathered around it. Shturmi took the lead after ten minutes with Dinamo equalizing five minutes later. Numerous attempts to break the well-defending rivals reached a dramatic end in stoppage time when the hosts were awarded a penalty kick. However, goalkeeper Omar Migineishvili saved it and with final score 1-1 Shturmi were denied a victory.\n\nIn late January 2021 Georgian Football Federation decided to enlarge Liga 4 at the expense of all four second-placed Regionuli Liga clubs from the previous season with Shturmi being among these promoted teams.\n\nThe start in the fourth tier was less impressive. However, the team drastically improved in the second stage, won ten games, including with 7-0 and 9-0, and prevailed in the final match of the season with a 12-0 victory.\n\nSeasons\n\nPlayers\nAs of April 2021\n\n(C)\n\nStadium\n\nShturmi play home games at Central stadium in Sartichala, which is due to undergo  major reconstruction works according to an electronic tender, announced in January 2021.

Tornike Chaduneli, the former Torpedo Kutaisi defender and Sarti manager, took charge of the team.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season was suspended until August, when a single-round competition between 14 clubs of Group D East began.\n\nBeing debutants in the Georgian league, the club from the very outset displayed an attacking football which greatly contributed to thrashing some rivals. By mid-season with the seven matches behind Shturmi had won five of them with a large margin and reached an astonishing 31:5 aggregate goal difference.\n\nIn mid-October the team was placed in a two-week COVID quarantine. Straight after the games were resumed, Shturmi set their own record by winning 12–0. Until the final game week the club kept beating all other opponents, although so did Dinamo-2 Tbilisi who, apart from the same winning run, had a better goal advantage. The decisive tie was supposed to determine a winner of the league group with promotion to Liga 4.\n\nThe match on 20 December in Sartichala drew a great interest among the cheering locals who, unable to get inside the ground, gathered around it. Shturmi took the lead after ten minutes with Dinamo equalizing five minutes later. Numerous attempts to break the well-defending rivals reached a dramatic end in stoppage time when the hosts were awarded a penalty kick. However, goalkeeper Omar Migineishvili saved it and with final score 1-1 Shturmi were denied a victory.\n\nIn late January 2021 Georgian Football Federation decided to enlarge Liga 4 at the expense of all four second-placed Regionuli Liga clubs from the previous season with Shturmi being among these promoted teams.\n\nThe start in the fourth tier was less impressive. However, the team drastically improved in the second stage, won ten games, including with 7-0 and 9-0, and prevailed in the final match of the season with a 12-0 victory.\n\nSeasons\n\nPlayers\nAs of April 2021\n\n(C)\n\nStadium\n\nShturmi play home games at Central stadium in Sartichala, which is due to undergo  major reconstruction works according to an electronic tender, announced in January 2021. For this reason the team hosted all their Liga 4 rivals at Sagarejo football ground.\n\nName\n\nSFC stands for Sartichala Football Club while Georgian word shturmi can be translated as assault.\n\nExternal links\n Page on Facebook\n\nReferences\n\nFootball clubs in Georgia (country)\n2020 establishments in Georgia (country)\nAssociation football clubs established in 2020",

He has been sold at Bonhams, Sotheby's and Christies and has seen increasing popularity by collectors.\n\nBates Joel exhibited from 1884 to 1922 and is catalogued as H B Joel, J H Boel and H Bates'' as his signatures are \"monogrammed with initials and difficult to read.\" This has led to Henry Bates Joel sometimes being referred to as John Henry Boel in auctions and on some portals; there is limited evidence that Boel was his actual name, but this is subject to speculation. Early examples of his paintings (during the 1890s) are usually dated, which is not the case for his later works.\n\nJoel is part of the 'late romantic movement', aimed at supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values. Bates will have been inspired by the likes of Turner and Constable, adding a 'contemporary, Victorian, perspective' to traditional imagery. Paintings such as 'Loch Lomod' are typical for Bates Joel's style; \"refined and vibrant yet with strongly romanticised aura.\" Henry Bates Joel's primary medium of painting was oil but many watercolours exist as well.\n\nJoel also painted the Isle of Wight, some of his paintings (such as 'Bonchurch, near Ventnor, Isle of Wight', which shows an impressionist influence) are exhibited in Milntown Estate. Clifton park and museum displays some of his paintings as well.\n\nReferences \n\n1875 births\n1922 deaths\nDate of birth missing\nDate of death missing\nPlace of birth missing\nPlace of death missing\nBritish landscape painters\n19th-century British painters\n20th-century British painters",

While the station has a waiting room, it is only open in early mornings and late evenings, half an hour before the first westbound and eastbound train arrives. It does not have a ticket agent, but the station does have personnel that can assist riders upon departure and arrival. The station is directly across the tracks from the National New York Central Railroad Museum.\n\nHistory \nElkhart station was originally built in 1900 by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and had a freight house installed across the tracks in 1907. The building is constructed of red brick trimmed with limestone, which is used for the window surrounds and belt course.

It combines influences of Type O Negative, The Sisters of Mercy, Peter Gabriel, dark wave and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of electronic music, jazz fusion, post-punk, gothic rock and new wave.  It was produced by Toby Driver.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on The Flenser for one of Driver's other bands, Vaura, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album. Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDriver has said that the album was influenced by dark wave as well as Type O Negative, Peter Gabriel and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by dark wave and was written as evoking \"1980s retrofuture noir.\"\n\nDriver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of Hubardo resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior Kayo Dot albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior Kayo Dot albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically Blade Runner.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through The Flenser. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in MP3, FLAC, CD and LP. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction.

They were both initially to be released at some point during November, but for some reasons they did not come into fruition until a later date.\n\nThe \"Nero Forte\" music video stars the band, who jam out and perform in a white limbo, constantly flashed by coloured beaming lights, at points surrounding what seems to be a fan inside of a cocoon, which has something inside which appears to try to be trying to escape and be reborn.\n\nAs of December 2021, the song has 40 million views on YouTube.\n\nCharts\n\nReferences \n\nSongs written by Corey Taylor\nSongs written by Jim Root\nSongs written by Shawn Crahan\n2019 songs\n2019 singles\nSlipknot (band) songs\nRoadrunner Records singles",

It became commonly known as the Fortress of Hunger (Fortaleza del hambre). The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island.

Based in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, El Meson Sandwiches is Puerto Rico's largest restaurant chain. In 2012 it was named one of the world's top fast food chains by Travel & Leisure magazine.\n\nEl Meson Sandwiches is family-owned and operated. It has 37 locations in Puerto Rico and three in Florida, at the Florida Mall, in Kissimmee and Lee Vista Promenade.\n\nEl Meson began franchising in 2018. El Meson Sandwiches units average $2 million in sales per year. System-wide sales in 2015 were just under $80 million.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first El Meson Sandwiches opened in 1972 in the beach town of Aguadilla on Puerto Rico's northwestern tip. The restaurant was started by Felipe Perez Sr., father of the current CEO, Felipe Pérez Grajales. The original restaurant was known primarily for two things: home-style sandwiches and a familial atmosphere.\n\nMany of El Meson's early customers were American surfers who came early in the day asking for big, healthy breakfasts. Their requests prompted Perez Sr. to create a sandwich dubbed The Surfer, which comes stuffed with fresh vegetables and soy-based protein.

The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nBackground \nIn 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58–7. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.\n\nThe rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.\n\nThe documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.\n\nCast \nCreadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall. The film also features interviews with head coaches Lou Holtz and Jimmy Johnson; Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez; Notre Dame players Chris Zorich, Pat Eilers, Pat Terrell, and Todd Lyght, among others; and Miami players Steve Walsh, Cleveland Gary, and Leon Searcy, among others.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson called Catholics vs. Convicts a \"gripping gridiron drama.\" Sporting News ranks the film \"among the best\" of the 30 for 30 franchise.\n\nReferences \n\nNotre Dame vs. Miami\nMiami Hurricanes football\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish football\n30 for 30\n2016 television films",

The dark D-type asteroid belongs to the 20 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 10.15 hours. It was named after the Greek hero and great archer, Teucer.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nTeucer is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's  Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.6 AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,213 days; semi-major axis of 5.1 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first observation as  at Turku Observatory in December 1940, more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Teucer, from Greek mythology. The son of King Telamon was a great archer and half-brother of Ajax, with whom he fought alongside in the Trojan War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 17 February 1984 ().\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nTeucer has been characterized as a dark D-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS' survey as well as in the SDSS-based taxonomy. It is also an assumed C-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period \n\nSeveral rotational lightcurves of Teucer have been obtained from photometric observations since 1992.

However, not all technical terms have been replaced, and some sections still contain original text without emoji substitutions, which prevents the score from being a perfect 1.0.",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.9\n\nThe similarity score is 0.9 because the majority of the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with relevant emojis in Text2.

However, there are a few instances where technical terms were not replaced with emojis, such as \"Lagrangian point\" and \"resonance\".

Opened in 1975, the mall's anchor stores are County Market, Pet Supplies Plus, Dunham's Sports, Ross Dress for Less, Citi Trends, Jo-Ann Fabrics, Burlington, Shoe Sensation, Slumberland Furniture, and AMC Theatres. There are 2 vacant anchor store that were once Carson's and Sears. It is managed by T Danville, a division of Tabani Group.\n\nHistory\nVillage Mall was developed in the 1970s by SES Development Company. The first store to open was an Ayr-Way discount store in 1972, which later became Target. It was followed by  a National Supermarkets and a Meis department store, which was later sold to Elder-Beerman. The mall itself opened in 1975. J. C. Penney was added in 1985. Sears, which previously had a store in downtown Danville, was offered an incentive by the city to move to the mall in the early 1990s.\n\nTarget closed in 1997 due to low sales, and by 1999 had become a Hobby Lobby. J. C. Penney closed its Danville store in 2001 along with two others in Illinois. In 2004, a wing of the mall was renovated to make room for a Goody's clothing store. The former J. C. Penney store became Steve & Barry's in 2006. That same year, several anchors were proposed for the mall, including Old Navy and Dunham's Sports. County Market, which replaced National Supermarket, was also expanded.\n\nHobby Lobby, Steve & Barry's, and Goody's all closed in 2008, the latter two due to bankruptcy of the chains. The loss of these stores led to rumors that the mall would close or be converted to other uses, or that Elder-Beerman or Sears would relocate to elsewhere in town.\n\nDespite these closures, Pet Supplies Plus opened in part of the former Hobby Lobby. By 2010, the last restaurant had closed in the food court. Elder-Beerman was re-branded Carson's in 2011, and Dunham's Sports filled the rest of the former Hobby Lobby. The former Goody's space became Ross Dress for Less in mid-2012. In mid-2013, Burlington Coat Factory opened in the former J. C. Penney/Steve & Barry's space. The addition of new stores brought occupancy levels up to 78 percent. In September 2014, Sears announced that it would close the Village Mall store. In mid-2015, a Jo-Ann Fabrics was added to the mall, while the city of Danville offered an incentive to the Slumberland Furniture chain to open a store in part of the former Sears.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, The Bon-Ton Stores announced that Carson's would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2018. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that The Bon-Ton Stores would be going out of business due to bankruptcy.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n\nShopping malls in Illinois\nShopping malls established in 1975\nBuildings and structures in Danville, Illinois",

The building is constructed of red brick trimmed with limestone, which is used for the window surrounds and belt course. The station was originally set amid a well-kept garden that displayed neat beds of colorful flowers and a row of trees along the tracks; this manicured landscape was not only a pretty introduction to the city for first time visitors, but it also buffered the streets of downtown from the noise and dirt associated with steam engines and freight trains. The station and the railroad were acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1914. NYC merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, and passenger service was taken over by Amtrak in 1971.

However, not all technical terms have been replaced, and some terms like \"Leggett's Lake\" and \"Grayson Canal\" remain unchanged.

It has smooth white to cream-coloured bark that is shed in ribbons, sometimes with rough, fibrous or flaky bark at the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green leaves that are a paler shade on the lower side, egg-shaped to lance-shaped or elliptical,  long and  wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to  long. Mature buds are oval,  long and  wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering has been recorded in October and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped or urn-shaped capsule  long and  wide\nwith the valves below the level of the rim.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus olsenii was first formally described in 1980 by Lawrie Johnsone and Don Blaxell in the journal Telopea.

It became commonly known as the Fortress of Hunger (Fortaleza del hambre). The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island. Charles III of Spain, who was concerned for the plight of the islanders, ordered that the fortress be built.\n \nSituated on a cliff above the Port of Naos, the D shaped fort has semi-circular walls facing the sea. On the landward side, the rear wall is protected by two small turrets, with a moat crossed by a lifting drawbridge leading to the main gateway. The fortress is constructed of masonry and ashlar blocks of volcanic origin. The interior which is made up of barrel vaulted rooms was mainly used as a powder store.\n\nInternational Museum of Contemporary Art\nIn the 1970s the fortress was renovated and the interior redesigned by the artist César Manrique, who was born nearby, to house a museum of modern art.  The museum opened to the public in 1976 as the International Museum of Contemporary Art (, abbreviated as MIAC).\n\nThe exhibits are primarily from the period between 1950 and 1980, with a focus on various abstract art forms, such as modern sculpture, kinetic art, and geometric abstraction. The works are mainly by Spanish artists including Joan Miró,  Antoni Tàpies, Eusebio Sempere and the El Paso group, one section is also dedicated to the Canarian artist Pancho Lasso.\n\nThe courtyard is also used as a display space for outdoor sculptures and designs.\nBeneath the museum, the annexe of the fort was renovated and converted into a restaurant, the two  connected by a spiral staircase. With curved floor to ceiling windows, the dining room has panoramic views overlooking the harbour and docks below.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nArrecife\nMuseums in the Canary Islands\nModern art museums in Spain\nCastles in Canary Islands\nBien de Interés Cultural landmarks in the Province of Las Palmas\nBuildings and structures in Lanzarote\nTourist attractions in Lanzarote",

He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Southwark on 4 October 1864. Cahill had been Rector of Ryde since 1868, and vicar-general of the diocese since its foundation.\n\nHe was appointed an Auxiliary Bishop of Portsmouth and Titular Bishop of Thagora on 21 March 1900. His consecration to the Episcopate took place on 1 May 1900, the principal consecrator was Francis Bourne, Bishop of Southwark (later Archbishop of Westminster), and the principal co-consecrators were John Cuthbert Hedley, Bishop of Newport and Menevia and Charles Maurice Graham, Coadjutor Bishop of Plymouth. Bishop Vertue died three weeks later. Three months later, Cahill was appointed Bishop of Portsmouth on 30 August 1900.\n\nCahill completed the cathedral by adding the west front, and carried out several important changes in the interior. Cahill's ten year episcopate was marked by the influx of religious communities, owing to the French persecutions.
