In 1900, they sold the company to John Henry Kirby. In 1892, he invested $1,000 into Pattillo Higgins's Gladys City Oil Company and was elected as its president due to him being the only investor to give capital instead of land.

        "text": "The Casa de Portugal is an association of Portuguese immigrants in S\u00e3o Paulo created in 1935.\n\nHistory \nThe Casa de Portugal was founded on 13 July 1935 with the aim of representing all Portuguese immigrants and their descendants in S\u00e3o Paulo. There were many Portuguese associations in the city, representing immigrants from specific regions of Portugal, and the original idea of the founders was to bring these organizations under one roof. The foundation of the Casa de Portugal saw representatives of Uni\u00e3o Transmontana, Casa do Minho, Uni\u00e3o Portuguesa, Centro Beir\u00e3o and Centro do Douro. Other organizations were subsequently invited, but preferred to maintain their regional character and refused. The first president was the philologist Francisco da Luz Rebelo Gon\u00e7alves, a professor at the newly founded University of S\u00e3o Paulo, but he remained in office for only 10 months and was succeeded for the interim by Aur\u00e9lio Martins Arrobas and in 1936 by Fernando Ribeiro Bacellar.\n\nInitially the Casa de Portugal worked at the headquarters of the Casa do Minho and then in rented properties. Through donations from members and bank loans land and buildings were purchased on the Avenida da Liberdade, in the city center in 1943. The inauguration of the headquarters took place on December 27, 1955.\n\nFeatures \nThe headquarters of the Casa de Portugal is a neocolonial building of five floors designed by Portuguese architect Ricardo Severo. The lobby is decorated with paintings depicting Afonso I, the first king of Portugal, and Manuel da Nobrega, a Portuguese Jesuit priest very influential in the early History of Brazil, and who participated in the founding of several cities, such as Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, and many Jesuit Colleges and seminaries. The building also has meeting rooms, a restaurant, theater, gallery exhibition and a ballroom with a capacity for 1,000 people.\n\nThe Casa de Portugal also serves as headquarters for the Council of the Luso-Brazilian Community of S\u00e3o Paulo, the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and the Ombudsman of the Portuguese Community. It was also headquarters for the Consulate of Portugal in S\u00e3o Paulo and the Cam\u00f5es Institute, but these institutions have moved to a building in the Jardim Am\u00e9rica area in 2004.\n\nLibrary \nThe creation of a library for the Casa de Portugal had been planned since its foundation, when the partners began to donate books to the collection. In 1957 the library was opened, and in 1991 it was extended with an auditorium and reading room. Currently it has 12,000 volumes, of which almost half are dedicated to history and Luso-Brazilian literature.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n Facebook page of Casa de Portugal\n\nPortuguese emigrants to Brazil\nPortuguese diaspora\nOrganisations based in S\u00e3o Paulo\n1935 establishments in Brazil"

Based in Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico, El Meson Sandwiches is Puerto Rico's largest restaurant chain. In 2012 it was named one of the world's top fast food chains by Travel & Leisure magazine.\n\nEl Meson Sandwiches is family-owned and operated. It has 37 locations in Puerto Rico and three in Florida, at the Florida Mall, in Kissimmee and Lee Vista Promenade.\n\nEl Meson began franchising in 2018. El Meson Sandwiches units average $2 million in sales per year. System-wide sales in 2015 were just under $80 million.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first El Meson Sandwiches opened in 1972 in the beach town of Aguadilla on Puerto Rico's northwestern tip. The restaurant was started by Felipe Perez Sr., father of the current CEO, Felipe P\u00e9rez Grajales. The original restaurant was known primarily for two things: home-style sandwiches and a familial atmosphere.\n\nMany of El Meson's early customers were American surfers who came early in the day asking for big, healthy breakfasts. Their requests prompted Perez Sr. to create a sandwich dubbed The Surfer, which comes stuffed with fresh vegetables and soy-based protein. The second Puerto Rico location opened in 1987, shortly after the younger Perez returned from college in Jacksonville, Florida. Rapid growth followed.\n\nProducts\n\nEl Meson sandwiches are mostly served on criollo bread, a sweet, French-style bread with a Caribbean flavor. Most are pressed on a hot grill and served with cabbage, tomatoes, and mayo. The Delicioso sandwich comes with turkey and bacon. The White House is grilled with roast beef, turkey and mushrooms. El Meson also serves sandwiches on baked potatoes.\n\nCurrent leadership\n\nFelipe P\u00e9rez Grajales is the current CEO of El Meson Sandwiches. He was born in 1965, the eldest of three brothers. From the early 1970s through his high school years, Grajales worked in the original El Meson restaurant in Aguadilla. In 1983 he left Puerto Rico to attend Jacksonville University. Though he received several offers from companies in the U.S., he returned to Puerto Rico in 1986 to help expand the family business.\n\nGrajales has been recognized as an outstanding businessman by Ernst & Young, the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce, the Sales & Marketing Executives (SME) Association, and the House of Representatives and Senate of Puerto Rico.\n\nHe was president of the Organizing Committee for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayag\u00fcez in 2010 and is president of the Mayag\u00fcez 2010 Foundation.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Meson Sandwiches Official Website\n Puerto Rican El Meson Sandwiches Website (In Spanish)\n\n1972 establishments in Puerto Rico\nRestaurants in Puerto Rico\nMayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico\nPrivately held companies of Puerto Rico\nPuerto Rican brands\nRestaurants established in 1972"

        "text": "SFC Sturmi is a Georgian football club based in Sartichala. Being one of the youngest domestic teams, they take part in Liga 4, the fourth tier of Georgian league system.\n\nHistory\nOn 6 March 2020 some media outlets announced that newly formed FC Shturmi Sartichala would replace FC Sarti Sartichala, dissolved in 2018, and represent the town in Regional league. Tornike Chaduneli, the former Torpedo Kutaisi defender and Sarti manager, took charge of the team.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season was suspended until August, when a single-round competition between 14 clubs of Group D East began.\n\nBeing debutants in the Georgian league, the club from the very outset displayed an attacking football which greatly contributed to thrashing some rivals. By mid-season with the seven matches behind Shturmi had won five of them with a large margin and reached an astonishing 31:5 aggregate goal difference.\n\nIn mid-October the team was placed in a two-week COVID quarantine. Straight after the games were resumed, Shturmi set their own record by winning 12\u20130. Until the final game week the club kept beating all other opponents, although so did Dinamo-2 Tbilisi who, apart from the same winning run, had a better goal advantage. The decisive tie was supposed to determine a winner of the league group with promotion to Liga 4.\n\nThe match on 20 December in Sartichala drew a great interest among the cheering locals who, unable to get inside the ground, gathered around it. Shturmi took the lead after ten minutes with Dinamo equalizing five minutes later. Numerous attempts to break the well-defending rivals reached a dramatic end in stoppage time when the hosts were awarded a penalty kick. However, goalkeeper Omar Migineishvili saved it and with final score 1-1 Shturmi were denied a victory.\n\nIn late January 2021 Georgian Football Federation decided to enlarge Liga 4 at the expense of all four second-placed Regionuli Liga clubs from the previous season with Shturmi being among these promoted teams.\n\nThe start in the fourth tier was less impressive. However, the team drastically improved in the second stage, won ten games, including with 7-0 and 9-0, and prevailed in the final match of the season with a 12-0 victory.\n\nSeasons\n\nPlayers\nAs of April 2021\n\n(C)\n\nStadium\n\nShturmi play home games at Central stadium in Sartichala, which is due to undergo  major reconstruction works according to an electronic tender, announced in January 2021.

In 1645 he was given the title of Prince of Brazil, a new crown-princely position thus created. Also, his father granted him the duchy as 10th Duke of Braganza, presumably after his uncle Duarte died in 1649.\n\nBiography\n\nHe was born on 8 February, 1634 in Vila Vi\u00e7osa and was the heir to the throne of Portugal from 1641 until his death at only 19 years of age.\n\nWhen the prince was 13 years old he took part in the State Council's reunions.\n\nTeod\u00f3sio's death, on 15 May, 1653, due to tuberculosis, caused great unrest in the kingdom. His next brother, the medically and mentally problem-ridden Infante Afonso, succeeded him as Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza and heir-apparent of the kingdom. Due to mental incapacity and impotence, Afonso would eventually be deposed by Pedro, Duke of Beja and died childless.\n\nInterests\nTeod\u00f3sio was a very gifted young man. He knew Greek and Latin, was keen on philosophy and well respected amongst the great intellectuals of the time.\n\nThe Prince had a great interest in Astrology. He had a collection of charts of his family and made predictions on several political subjects.

He also served on the Los Angeles Common Council, the legislative branch of city government in that era.\n\nPersonal\n\nFamily\n\nWorkman was born October 20, 1835, in Missouri, the son of David Workman of Clifton-Penrith, England, and Nancy Hook of Virginia. He had a brother, William H. Workman. Around 1854 the family crossed the Great Plains to settle in Los Angeles.\n\nHe was married three times\u2014first, in Booneville, Missouri, shortly after the Civil War, to Julia C. Benedict (his childhood sweetheart), who died in 1876; then to Gilla Maria Corum of Boonville, in 1878 in Los Angeles; and finally, in 1884, to Anna K. Webb of Los Angeles; she died in 1900. He had two daughters, Gilleta M., and Laura (Mrs. Conrad Krebs).\n\nPersonality\n\nHis biography in the Los Angeles Public Library states that:\n\nElijah H. Workman was of the pioneer type of public figure: he wore boots to his dying day and lacked the more formal education of our times. With the conscientious fulfillment of his public duties[,] he combined the pioneer spirit of enterprise and development.\n\nIn politics he was a Democrat, and in religion a Protestant.\n\nDeath\n\nWorkman died July 17, 1906, at the age of 71 in his home at 1815 East Second Street, Boyle Heights.\n\nVocation\n\nWorkman was in the harness and saddlery business with his brother, William H. Workman, at 76 Main Street. They also dealt in hides, which were recognized as a medium of exchange throughout the Southwest.\n\nReturning from his trip to Missouri, Workman brought back seeds for trees and plants that he propagated in his own yard, getting the reputation of a \"pioneer agriculturalist.\" His property, surrounded by 10th and 11th streets, Hill and Main streets, was planted with orange trees and flowers.

        "text": "Catholics vs. Convicts is a 2016 documentary film about the 1988 Notre Dame-Miami football game directed by Patrick Creadon. It is the 87th film in ESPN's 30 for 30 series. The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nBackground \nIn 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58\u20137. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.\n\nThe rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.\n\nThe documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.\n\nCast \nCreadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall. The film also features interviews with head coaches Lou Holtz and Jimmy Johnson; Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez; Notre Dame players Chris Zorich, Pat Eilers, Pat Terrell, and Todd Lyght, among others; and Miami players Steve Walsh, Cleveland Gary, and Leon Searcy, among others.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson called Catholics vs. Convicts a \"gripping gridiron drama.\" Sporting News ranks the film \"among the best\" of the 30 for 30 franchise.\n\nReferences \n\nNotre Dame vs. Miami\nMiami Hurricanes football\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish football\n30 for 30\n2016 television films"

The artist's most popular motive was the Scottish highlands. Joel was a much respected artist during the Victorian and Edwardian era, valued especially for the vibrancy of his palette and 'flowing', 'sophisticated' brush strokes, yet was largely forgotten (and underestimated) in the late 20th and early 21st century. A prolific artist, his work is often seen on the market today. He has been sold at Bonhams, Sotheby's and Christies and has seen increasing popularity by collectors.\n\nBates Joel exhibited from 1884 to 1922 and is catalogued as H B Joel, J H Boel and H Bates'' as his signatures are \"monogrammed with initials and difficult to read.\" This has led to Henry Bates Joel sometimes being referred to as John Henry Boel in auctions and on some portals; there is limited evidence that Boel was his actual name, but this is subject to speculation. Early examples of his paintings (during the 1890s) are usually dated, which is not the case for his later works.\n\nJoel is part of the 'late romantic movement', aimed at supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values. Bates will have been inspired by the likes of Turner and Constable, adding a 'contemporary, Victorian, perspective' to traditional imagery. Paintings such as 'Loch Lomod' are typical for Bates Joel's style; \"refined and vibrant yet with strongly romanticised aura.\" Henry Bates Joel's primary medium of painting was oil but many watercolours exist as well.\n\nJoel also painted the Isle of Wight, some of his paintings (such as 'Bonchurch, near Ventnor, Isle of Wight', which shows an impressionist influence) are exhibited in Milntown Estate.

Cerri and his wife Mildred May Isaac.  Cerri started out in high school as an announcer in Utica on WIBX-AM and moved to ABC affiliate WRUN-AM (see WUTI) where he remained through college.  He graduated in 1959 from Utica College.\n\nHe moved to Washington, D.C. in 1960 and soon after was employed at WAVA-FM, where he created the show \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America.\"  Cerri hosted and produced at several area radio stations, including WHFS-FM and WJMD-FM which changed call sign to WLTT-FM (see WIAD) where the name of his show was shortened to \"Music Americana.\"   He was at WETA-FM from 1970 to 1973 where his brother Bill was also a disc jockey, well known for his classical music show.\n\nCerri had a very humble view of his reputation as an expert, instead typifying his role as a spectator, albeit a professional one.\n\nCerri started the World Folk Music Association with singer-songwriter Tom Paxton in 1982 and Cerri served as its president for much of its existence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Cerri also sponsored monthly musical concerts using the name of his radio show \"Music Americana.\"\n\nCerri retired in the mid-1990s and continued working with the World Folk Music Association (WFMA).  He was most recently working on digitizing his \"Music Americana\" radio shows, a project announced at the \"Remembering Dick Cerri: A Celebration in Song\", will be completed by the WFMA Foundation.  The extent of his influence can be gauged by the musicians at the September 27, 2014 concert: Noel Paul Stookey, Peter Yarrow (from Peter, Paul and Mary), Chad Mitchell, Christine Lavin, Schooner Fare, Squid Jiggers (Dave Rowe & Troy R.

        "text": "2797 Teucer  is a large Jupiter trojan from the Greek camp, approximately  in diameter. It was discovered on 4 June 1981, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at the Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, in the United States. The dark D-type asteroid belongs to the 20 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 10.15 hours. It was named after the Greek hero and great archer, Teucer.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nTeucer is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's  Lagrangian point, 60\u00b0 ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7\u20135.6\u00a0AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,213 days; semi-major axis of 5.1\u00a0AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 22\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first observation as  at Turku Observatory in December 1940, more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Teucer, from Greek mythology. The son of King Telamon was a great archer and half-brother of Ajax, with whom he fought alongside in the Trojan War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 17 February 1984 ().\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nTeucer has been characterized as a dark D-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS' survey as well as in the SDSS-based taxonomy. It is also an assumed C-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period \n\nSeveral rotational lightcurves of Teucer have been obtained from photometric observations since 1992. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve from September 2010, by Daniel Coley at the Center for Solar System Studies  gave a well-defined rotation period of  hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 magnitude ().\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Teucer measures between 89.43 and 113.99 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.059 and 0.073.\n\nThe Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0435 and a diameter of 110.72 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.8. In June 2014, an observed asteroid occultation gave a cross-section of  (poor fit).\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info )\n Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\n Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend\n Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center\n \n \n\n002797\nDiscoveries by Edward L.

Opened in 1975, the mall's anchor stores are County Market, Pet Supplies Plus, Dunham's Sports, Ross Dress for Less, Citi Trends, Jo-Ann Fabrics, Burlington, Shoe Sensation, Slumberland Furniture, and AMC Theatres. There are 2 vacant anchor store that were once Carson's and Sears. It is managed by T Danville, a division of Tabani Group.\n\nHistory\nVillage Mall was developed in the 1970s by SES Development Company. The first store to open was an Ayr-Way discount store in 1972, which later became Target. It was followed by  a National Supermarkets and a Meis department store, which was later sold to Elder-Beerman. The mall itself opened in 1975. J. C. Penney was added in 1985. Sears, which previously had a store in downtown Danville, was offered an incentive by the city to move to the mall in the early 1990s.\n\nTarget closed in 1997 due to low sales, and by 1999 had become a Hobby Lobby. J. C. Penney closed its Danville store in 2001 along with two others in Illinois. In 2004, a wing of the mall was renovated to make room for a Goody's clothing store. The former J. C. Penney store became Steve & Barry's in 2006. That same year, several anchors were proposed for the mall, including Old Navy and Dunham's Sports. County Market, which replaced National Supermarket, was also expanded.\n\nHobby Lobby, Steve & Barry's, and Goody's all closed in 2008, the latter two due to bankruptcy of the chains. The loss of these stores led to rumors that the mall would close or be converted to other uses, or that Elder-Beerman or Sears would relocate to elsewhere in town.\n\nDespite these closures, Pet Supplies Plus opened in part of the former Hobby Lobby. By 2010, the last restaurant had closed in the food court. Elder-Beerman was re-branded Carson's in 2011, and Dunham's Sports filled the rest of the former Hobby Lobby. The former Goody's space became Ross Dress for Less in mid-2012. In mid-2013, Burlington Coat Factory opened in the former J. C. Penney/Steve & Barry's space. The addition of new stores brought occupancy levels up to 78 percent. In September 2014, Sears announced that it would close the Village Mall store. In mid-2015, a Jo-Ann Fabrics was added to the mall, while the city of Danville offered an incentive to the Slumberland Furniture chain to open a store in part of the former Sears.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, The Bon-Ton Stores announced that Carson's would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2018. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that The Bon-Ton Stores would be going out of business due to bankruptcy.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n\nShopping malls in Illinois\nShopping malls established in 1975\nBuildings and structures in Danville, Illinois"

While the station has a waiting room, it is only open in early mornings and late evenings, half an hour before the first westbound and eastbound train arrives. It does not have a ticket agent, but the station does have personnel that can assist riders upon departure and arrival. The station is directly across the tracks from the National New York Central Railroad Museum.\n\nHistory \nElkhart station was originally built in 1900 by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and had a freight house installed across the tracks in 1907. The building is constructed of red brick trimmed with limestone, which is used for the window surrounds and belt course. The station was originally set amid a well-kept garden that displayed neat beds of colorful flowers and a row of trees along the tracks; this manicured landscape was not only a pretty introduction to the city for first time visitors, but it also buffered the streets of downtown from the noise and dirt associated with steam engines and freight trains. The station and the railroad were acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1914. NYC merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, and passenger service was taken over by Amtrak in 1971. The freight house became the National NYC Museum in 1987.\n\nTransit connections \n\nMACOG Interurban Trolley's Elkhart-Goshen and Concord routes both stop near the station. However, because of the way the train schedules are currently set up, riders can only connect to westbound trains. Riders who wish to board eastbound trains would have to arrive several hours ahead of time. Elkhart-Goshen route connects to westbound Capitol Limited and Lake Shore Limited trains, while Concord route can only connect to westbound Lake Shore Limited train.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nElkart Amtrak Station (USA Rail Guide -- Train Web)\nElkhart Station (EKH) Great American Stations (Amtrak)\nNational New York Central Railroad Museum (Official Site)\n\nAmtrak stations in Indiana\nFormer New York Central Railroad stations\nRailway stations in the United States opened in 1900\nTransportation in Elkhart, Indiana\nTransportation buildings and structures in Elkhart County, Indiana"

Chiapas is officially divided into 124 municipalities, although the establishment of municipal authorities in Belisario Dom\u00ednguez was suspended in 2015 pending the resolution of a territorial dispute between Chiapas and the neighbouring state of Oaxaca. In 2021, the Mexican Supreme Court resolved this dispute in Oaxaca's favour, and annulled the 2011 decree that had created Belisario Dom\u00ednguez.\n\nMunicipalities in Chiapas are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: presidente municipal) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (ayuntamiento) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (regidores y s\u00edndicos). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.\n\nThe largest municipality by population is the state capital Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, with 604,147 residents while the smallest is Sunuapa with 2,308 residents.

Each player has four minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. Hitters are awarded an additional 30 seconds if they hit two home runs over . Hitters are also allowed one 45 second timeout to stop the clock (two in the finals). Homers hit off a T-Mobile Ball during the final minute result in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile & MLB, to Team Rubicon.\n\nThe eight competing players are seeded 1-8 based on their home run totals. While the lower seed hits first, the higher seed hits second in all rounds. The round ends if the higher seed exceeds the total of the first hitter. In the event of a tie, three sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 90-second swing-off (with no timeouts nor bonus time awarded); second, each player gets three swings; whoever hits more home runs in the three swings will be declared the winner; thereafter, sudden death swings will occur until the tie is broken.\n\nBracket\n\nReferences\n\n2018\nMajor League Baseball Home Run Derby, 2018\nBaseball in Washington, D.C.\nMajor League Baseball Home Run Derby"

It has smooth bark with rough bark on the lower trunk, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and barrel-shaped or urn-shaped fruit.\n\nDescription\nEucalyptus olsenii is a tree that typically grows to a height of  high and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white to cream-coloured bark that is shed in ribbons, sometimes with rough, fibrous or flaky bark at the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green leaves that are a paler shade on the lower side, egg-shaped to lance-shaped or elliptical,  long and  wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to  long. Mature buds are oval,  long and  wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering has been recorded in October and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped or urn-shaped capsule  long and  wide\nwith the valves below the level of the rim.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus olsenii was first formally described in 1980 by Lawrie Johnsone and Don Blaxell in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (olsenii) honours Ian Sinclair Olsen, who recognised the species as distinct on a bushwalking expedition lead by Henry Fairlie-Cuninghame who collected the type material.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nWoila gum is restricted to mountains north east of Cooma and south of Braidwood, where it grows in woodland in poor soil on steep slopes. It also grows well as an ornamental tree.\n\nReferences\n\nolsenii\nMyrtales of Australia\nTrees of Australia\nFlora of New South Wales\nPlants described in 1980\nTaxa named by Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson"

It is a follow up to 2013's Hubardo. It's the first album from Kayo Dot to not be self-released since 2012's Gamma Knife. Coffins on Io marks a notable change in sound. It combines influences of Type O Negative, The Sisters of Mercy, Peter Gabriel, dark wave and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of electronic music, jazz fusion, post-punk, gothic rock and new wave.  It was produced by Toby Driver.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on The Flenser for one of Driver's other bands, Vaura, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album. Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDriver has said that the album was influenced by dark wave as well as Type O Negative, Peter Gabriel and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by dark wave and was written as evoking \"1980s retrofuture noir.\"\n\nDriver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of Hubardo resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior Kayo Dot albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior Kayo Dot albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically Blade Runner.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through The Flenser. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in MP3, FLAC, CD and LP. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction. Empty Lighthouse called it \"Kayo Dot's best album to date\" and celebrates its ability to \"nail the noir feel,\" describing the album as \"Lynchian\". Re-views Media writer Michael Snoxall gave the album four stars out of five, saying the album feels familiar yet alien at the same time, and that the album is a \"monumental\" and \"towering achievement.\" SputnikMusic gave it a 4/5, saying it \"hums with sleek resonance\" and calling the album \"vibrant and exciting.\"\n\nTrack listing\nMusic by Toby Driver.

        "text": "\"Nero Forte\" is a song by American heavy metal band Slipknot. Produced by Greg Fidelman, it was released as the fourth single from the band's sixth studio album We Are Not Your Kind on December 16, 2019.\n\nBackground  \n\"Nero Forte\" was released on December 16, 2019 as the band's fourth single off their sixth studio album We Are Not Your Kind, following after the release of \"Birth of the Cruel\" four months previously. The song's title \"Nero\" and \"Forte\" are Italian words that mean \"black\" and \"strong\" respectively. \"Forte\" can also mean something in which you excel.\n\nRecording and meaning  \nThough the song title does not appear in the lyrics, it describes the darkness that Taylor sunk into. The depression was like an entity that he did not feel he had the strength to fight against. When talking about the song, guitarist\u00a0Jim Root stated: \"This is also a\u00a0Clown song, which is amazing. This one is going to be great live. It's very percussive and reminiscent of\u00a0\"Psychosocial\", but maybe an evolution of \"Psychosocial\". Obviously, Clown is a drummer and percussionist, but he's also a songwriter\u2014and he always has been. Now we're able to collaborate as songwriters, and this is what we end up with. When Corey came in and started diving into the vocals, he came up with this extra melody in the chorus line, very late into the process. That really drew me into this song.\"\n\nMusic video  \nShawn Crahan, Slipknot's percussionist and founder, directed the video along with a 20 minute short film titled Pollution, which would be released on the same day as the \"Nero Forte\". They were both recorded within two days, on both the 29th and 30 October. They were both initially to be released at some point during November, but for some reasons they did not come into fruition until a later date.\n\nThe \"Nero Forte\" music video stars the band, who jam out and perform in a white limbo, constantly flashed by coloured beaming lights, at points surrounding what seems to be a fan inside of a cocoon, which has something inside which appears to try to be trying to escape and be reborn.\n\nAs of December 2021, the song has 40 million views on YouTube.\n\nCharts\n\nReferences \n\nSongs written by Corey Taylor\nSongs written by Jim Root\nSongs written by Shawn Crahan\n2019 songs\n2019 singles\nSlipknot (band) songs\nRoadrunner Records singles"

Some authorities, such as Froelich (1991), Collins and Dubach (2001) and Nieves (2005), do not recognize the Black-headed spider monkey as a distinct species and so treat the Colombian spider monkey as a subspecies of Geoffroy's spider monkey.\n\nThe Colombian spider monkey lives in dry forests, humid forests and cloud forests, and can live up to  above sea level. It is entirely black with some white on its chin while the Brown-headed spider monkey (A. f. fusciceps) has a black or brown body and a brown head.\n\nThe spider monkey has a black body and long limbs with thumb-less hands.  It has a prehensile and extremely flexible tail, which acts as an extra limb.  The tail has a hairless patch on the tip that is used for grip.  This hairless patch is unique in its markings, just like the human fingerprint.  Colombian spider monkeys can weigh up to 9.1\u00a0kg (20 pounds).  Fruit makes up eighty percent of the spider monkey's diet, which also includes leaves, nuts, seeds, bark, insects, and flowers. Spider monkeys contribute to the dispersion of undigested seeds from the fruits they eat. This monkey lives approximately 24 years.\n\nSpider monkeys are found in social groups of up to 30 individuals; however, they are usually broken up into smaller foraging groups of 3-4 individuals.  They move and climb through the forest by hand over hand (brachiation) motion.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Animal Bytes\n\nPrimates of Central America\nMammals of Colombia\nSpider monkeys\nMammals described in 1872\nTaxa named by Philip Sclater"

        "text": "Soluble transferrin receptor conventionally refers to the cleaved extracellular portion of transferrin receptor 1 that is released into serum. This receptor is a protein dimer of two identical subunits, linked together by two pairs of disulfide bonds.\nIts molecular mass 190,000 Dalton.\n\nBlood testing of the soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is used as a measure of functional iron status and the investigation of iron deficiency anemia. Ferritin, a routine investigation for anemia, is an acute-phase reactant, and may be elevated in states of inflammation, thereby falsely indicating that iron stores are adequate. Because sTfR is insensitive to inflammation, it can detect anemia in patients with preexisting inflammatory states, and is particularly useful in distinguishing between the anemia of chronic disease and anemias caused by lack of iron intake.\n\nTo date, the conventionally identified soluble transferrin receptor has not been itself implicated in intracellular delivery of transferrin and associated iron stores.\n\nA soluble receptor for any ligand could also refer to a molecule present is solution (for example a secretory protein) which would bind with the target ligand and then  effect cellular delivery. In this context the multifunctional glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been reported as a soluble receptor for transferrin. It has been demonstrated to deliver more transferrin as compared to the receptors anchored on the cells surface in numerous cell types.\n\nSee also\nFerritin\nTransferrin\nTotal iron binding capacity\n\nCitations\n\nProteins"

        "text": "The Castillo de San Jos\u00e9 (Castle of San Jos\u00e9) is an historic fortress and art museum in Arrecife on the Canary Island of Lanzarote.\n\nHistory\nBuilt between 1776 and 1779 the fort was constructed to provide a defensive stronghold in case of pirate attacks, and as a public works project to provide much needed employment during a time of famine and poverty on the island. It became commonly known as the Fortress of Hunger (Fortaleza del hambre). The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island. Charles III of Spain, who was concerned for the plight of the islanders, ordered that the fortress be built.\n \nSituated on a cliff above the Port of Naos, the D shaped fort has semi-circular walls facing the sea. On the landward side, the rear wall is protected by two small turrets, with a moat crossed by a lifting drawbridge leading to the main gateway. The fortress is constructed of masonry and ashlar blocks of volcanic origin. The interior which is made up of barrel vaulted rooms was mainly used as a powder store.\n\nInternational Museum of Contemporary Art\nIn the 1970s the fortress was renovated and the interior redesigned by the artist C\u00e9sar Manrique, who was born nearby, to house a museum of modern art.  The museum opened to the public in 1976 as the International Museum of Contemporary Art (, abbreviated as MIAC).\n\nThe exhibits are primarily from the period between 1950 and 1980, with a focus on various abstract art forms, such as modern sculpture, kinetic art, and geometric abstraction. The works are mainly by Spanish artists including Joan Mir\u00f3,  Antoni T\u00e0pies, Eusebio Sempere and the El Paso group, one section is also dedicated to the Canarian artist Pancho Lasso.\n\nThe courtyard is also used as a display space for outdoor sculptures and designs.\nBeneath the museum, the annexe of the fort was renovated and converted into a restaurant, the two  connected by a spiral staircase. With curved floor to ceiling windows, the dining room has panoramic views overlooking the harbour and docks below.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nArrecife\nMuseums in the Canary Islands\nModern art museums in Spain\nCastles in Canary Islands\nBien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural landmarks in the Province of Las Palmas\nBuildings and structures in Lanzarote\nTourist attractions in Lanzarote"

In the 1949\u201350 season, the team was renamed as the Elefantes de Cienfuegos (Cienfuegos Elephants). \"The pace of the elephant is slow but crushing\", exclaimed the slogan of the Cienfuegos franchise that contended until the 1960\u201361 season. Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution, political tensions rose with the Fidel Castro government.

The neighborhood's name derives from Lazimpat Durbar, that lies in its vicinity and was converted into Hotel Shanker.\n\nLazimpat shares one border with Thamel, a popular tourist hub, and another with Baluwatar, a reputed residential area where the Prime Minister, Chief Justice, and the Chairman of Constitution Assembly reside. Lazimpat is just 20 minutes away from what is downtown of Kathmandu, Newroad and Ason.\n\nThere has been a recent upsurge in the construction activity in the region. Lazimpat boasts the only road connecting the northern part of the Kathmandu valley with the southern part. The roads are very busy, yet until a few years back, there was not much economic activity in the region. Luxury hotels, photo studios, department stores and corner shops have been a special feature of Lazimpat. It is centrally located and is also home to or nearby various embassies.\n\nThere are many hotels, such as Hotel Shanker and Radisson Hotel Nepal, restaurants and sweet shops situated in Lazimpat among various shopping outlets.\n\nEmbassies & Diplomatic Missions in Lazimpat include the Indian Embassy, the British Embassy, the Israeli Embassy, the French Embassy and the Delegation of the European Union to Nepal and also some Nepalese governmental offices, such as the Inland Revenue Department have their premises in the neighborhood.\n\nThe following organisations have their headquarters in Lazimpat:\n\nTransportation\nBusses of Sajha Yatayat serve Lazimpat.

        "title": "Autopharmacology",
        "text": "Autopharmacology relates to the scientific study of the regulation of body functions by the activity of its naturally existent (or endogenous) chemical factors of the tissues. A more restricted definition would consider substances that were first identified as external agents which had a documented action on physiological functions, but later were discovered as existing as endogenous factors. The best example is the class of endorphins, which, as its name implies, were discovered to exist in the brain and have specific receptors in it, by investigations on the mechanism of action of opioids, such as morphine.\n\nHistorically, the first approach to the concept of autopharmacology began with British physiologist and pharmacologist Henry Dale in the 1910s, discovered the role of acetylcholine in synaptic transmission, and later proved by Austrian physiologist Otto Loewi, to be the neurotransmitter involved in the proximal synapses of the autonomic nervous system (initially named Vagusstoff by Loewi, and later identified as acetylcholine). The same happened to another autonomic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (Akzeleransstoff by Loewi), which later proved to be chemically similar to a long used pharmacological agent, adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. Both scientists were awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their pioneering and important contributions.\n\nA research area where autopharmacology principles assumed great importance was that of pain and inflammation, due to the great number of endogenous messengers, transmitters and modulators involved in their complex response at molecular and cellular level. The control and regulation mechanisms of the circulatory system and renal functions and their interactions (such as the renin/angiotensin system) are also greatly influenced by autopharmacological agents; One of the autopharmacology pioneers was Professor Mauricio Rocha e Silva, leader of the team of Brazilian researchers who discovered bradykinin in 1948, an endogenous substance involved in hypotension in circulatory shock. Of course, all these systems are of extreme importance for clinical practice and for the discovery of new therapeutic drugs.\n\nEndogenous substances that could fall under the concept of autopharmacology are:\n\n Endorphins\n Dynorphin\n Bradykinin\n Prostaglandins\n Angiotensin\n Secretin\n Gastrin\n Cholecystokinin\n Histamine\n Cannabinoids\n Substance P\n\nThe main scientific criterion for an autopharmacological agent is the discovery of specific membrane receptors for it and, hopefully, its transduction and cell signaling mechanisms.\n\nThe term was never much of a mainstream concept, and has fallen into disuse, as research on basic mechanisms has advanced. In a recent literature search on PubMed, only six titles refer to the term autopharmacology.\n\nReferences\n\nPharmacology\nPhysiology"

He served as the second Roman Catholic Bishop of Portsmouth from 1900 to 1910.\n\nLife\nBorn in London on 2 September 1841, he was a student at St. Edmund's College, Ware between 1855 and 1863. He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Southwark on 4 October 1864. Cahill had been Rector of Ryde since 1868, and vicar-general of the diocese since its foundation.\n\nHe was appointed an Auxiliary Bishop of Portsmouth and Titular Bishop of Thagora on 21 March 1900. His consecration to the Episcopate took place on 1 May 1900, the principal consecrator was Francis Bourne, Bishop of Southwark (later Archbishop of Westminster), and the principal co-consecrators were John Cuthbert Hedley, Bishop of Newport and Menevia and Charles Maurice Graham, Coadjutor Bishop of Plymouth. Bishop Vertue died three weeks later. Three months later, Cahill was appointed Bishop of Portsmouth on 30 August 1900.\n\nCahill completed the cathedral by adding the west front, and carried out several important changes in the interior. Cahill's ten year episcopate was marked by the influx of religious communities, owing to the French persecutions. It was thus that the diocese was enriched by the presence of such congregations as the Benedictines of Solesmes, both monks and nuns. Five Abbeys (Douai, Quarr, Farnborough, Ryde, and East Cowes) were founded in the diocese.\n\nBishop Cahill died at Portsmouth on 2 August 1910, aged 68.\n\nReferences \n\n1841 births\n1910 deaths\nRoman Catholic clergy from London\nRoman Catholic bishops of Portsmouth\n20th-century Roman Catholic bishops in England"

He set up a printing shop in Livorno to publish the works of Enlightenment figures such as Francesco Algarotti and Cesare Beccaria. Coltellini was very interested in opera and made the acquaintance of Metastasio (the leading librettist of opera seria) as well as Christoph Willibald Gluck, Ranieri de' Calzabigi and Giacomo Durazzo, who were involved in the reform of Italian opera.\n\nIn 1763, Coltellini succeeded Metastasio as the Imperial Poet at the Court of Vienna. He provided libretti for Gluck, Hasse (Piramo e Tisbe) and Salieri, as well as revising Carlo Goldoni's La finta semplice so it could be set by Mozart. His collaboration with Traetta, Ifigenia in Aulide (1763), developed the operatic innovations of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. \nIn 1768, he wrote the libretto for Giuseppe Scarlatti's opera Dove \u00e8 amore \u00e8 gelosia, which was premiered at the newly refurbished theatre in \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov Castle for the wedding celebration of the eldest son of Prince Joseph Adam I of Schwarzenberg, in which he sang the role of Patrizio, one of the characters of the opera.\n\nColtellini was dismissed from the post in 1772 after one of his satires angered the Empress Maria Theresia, and he accepted the job of official librettist for the Imperial Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Here he provided texts for Giovanni Paisiello and Traetta (Antigona). He again fell into disgrace and his sudden death was rumoured to be the result of poisoning.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\nBooklet notes to Christophe Rousset's recording of Traetta's opera Antigona (Decca, 2000)\n\n1719 births\n1777 deaths\nItalian opera librettists\nItalian male writers\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart's librettists\nPeople from Livorno\n18th-century composers\n18th-century male musicians"

On leaving Georgetown, Morris entered the Jesuit novitiate at Frederick, Maryland, to prepare himself for the Catholic priesthood. However, the death of his father left him the sole support of his mother and sisters and he thereafter pursued the study of law.

This late-1950s to 1960s period was when North Korea had first declared autonomous diplomacy.\n\nDuring the Somali Democratic Republic, relations with North Korea were close, due to shared ideals and geopolitical interests. Both countries formally adhered to anti-imperialism and Marxism\u2013Leninism, and were aligned with the Soviet Union in the context of the wider Cold War. The Supreme Revolutionary Council established relations with the DPRK in 1970. President of Somalia Siad Barre made two visits to Pyongyang during his tenure, once in 1971. He then met with Kim Il-sung, and signed a bilateral agreement of technical and economic assistance.\n\nOver the following years, military cooperation intensified, with North Korea training and equipping the Somali Armed Forces. Additionally, due to a resentment against Ethiopia over the country's involvement in the Korean War, North Korean advisers trained pro-Somalia guerrilla forces active in the Ethiopian\u2013Somali conflict. This changed considerably after the communist Derg came to power in 1974, causing an eventual realignment of Soviet support towards Ethiopia. North Korea followed suit, and provided military aid to Ethiopia against Somalia during the Ethio-Somali War.\n\nAs of March 2014, North Korea and Somalia still officially maintain diplomatic relations according to the National Committee on North Korea.\n\nSee also\nForeign relations of North Korea\nForeign relations of Somalia\nSomalia\u2013South Korea relations\nDai Hong Dan incident\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDPRK Diplomatic Relations\n\nNorth Korea\nSomalia"

The crypt contains the remains of a fifth-century Roman basilica. The site was originally occupied by a Roman fort.\n\nA new church was built on the site in early in 717 by Duke Adalbert of Alsace, brother of Saint Odile, as part of a new convent, in which he installed his daughter Attala as the first abbess.\n\nThe Church also served for many years as the episcopal seat for the north of Alsace.\n\nThe church was rebuilt in 1220 in Romanesque-Gothic style.\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, St Stephen's was a parish church, the parish of Stephen's being one of the nine parishes of Strasbourg. In 1534, as the reform was being introduced in Strasbourg, the parish of St Stephen's was transferred to St William's, on account of the opposition of the cannonesses of St Stephen's to the new teaching.\n\nIn the seventeenth century Louis XIV closed the abbey and transferred it to the Visitandines to serve as a boarding school for young women, a function which continued up until the French Revolution. In 1714 the church was equipped with an organ by Andreas Silbermann, which is now in Bischheim. After the French Revolution, the building was used as a warehouse, then as a theatre. In 1802, the church was deprived of its tower and in 1805 this was transformed into a theatre.\n\nThe college, of which the church now forms part, began life in 1861 as a 'Petit seminaire' (literally 'little seminary'), educating future priests as well as lay students.\n\nAllied bombing destroyed much of the building in 1944. Only the wide transept with its triple apse survived. In 1956, the ancient site was excavated and a Merovingian apse was discovered beneath the foundations of the old tower. In 1961, the nave was renovated, exposing the timber structures. The church was classified as a historical monument in 1962.\n\nIn 2016, the monumental concert organ from the former conservatory located in the National Theatre of Strasbourg was moved into the nave in order to be used as a church organ. The instrument, a 1963 work by organ builder Curt Schwenkedel, had been out of use since 1995. It was entirely restored by Quentin Blumenroeder from Haguenau.\n\nAs the Church is now part of a school, public access is only possible on special occasions, such as European Heritage Days. The school owns some valuable historical tapestries from the abbey church, some of which can be seen in the nearby Notre Dame museum.\n\nExternal links \n\n Eglise Saint Etienne - 2 rue de la Pierre Large on archi-wiki.org \n website of the Saint-Etienne college\n Aerial photo on French historical monuments website\n\nReferences\n\nRoman Catholic churches in Strasbourg\nRoman Catholic chapels in France\nRoman sites in France\nRomanesque architecture in France\nMonuments historiques of Bas-Rhin"

The former post office building was remodeled, then occupied by the Army Corps of Engineers in the mid 1960s. The building was remodeled again in 1996, after the Corps of Engineers moved to another location. It is now occupied by the U. S.

It was launched in December 2004.\n\nInitially, it was only available on the Canal Digital satellite platform, but was launched on cable platforms, including Com Hem, later on. During its first full year, the channel had average ratings of 0,0 minutes per day and person (Mediam\u00e4tning i Skandinavien).\n\nIn February 2006, the Swedish government announced that the channel had received a license to broadcast unencrypted in the digital terrestrial network between 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The channel timeshares with ONE Television that broadcast between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Terrestrial broadcasting started in late May 2006. In February 2007, ONE Television was replaced by Kanal 9, which wanted to broadcast during other times than ONE Television did. The timeshare was altered so that Kanal 9 would broadcast from 5.40 p.m. to 5.40 a.m. on weekdays and from 2.30 p.m. to 2.30 a.m. on weekends, while The Voice TV would broadcast during the remaining time.\n\nDuring the channel's second full year, 2006, the ratings had increased slightly to 0,2 minutes per day and person. In 2007, it was viewed 0,3 minutes per day.\n\nIn March 2008, The Voice TV received a new broadcast license running from 1 April 2008.

The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Methodist Episcopal Society of Tyringham is located in Tyringham's small main village, on the west side of Main Road at Church Road, with the parsonage across Church Road to the south.  The church is a rectangular wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and mostly clapboarded exterior.  The front facade is finished flushboarding, and is sheltered by a projecting four-column Ionic portico.  The columns support a fully pedimented gable, which houses a series of recessed panels.  The main facade is blank except for the main entrance and wide corner pilasters.  The entrance opening is framed by pilasters and topped by a broad corniced entablature; the doorway within the opening is framed by paneling matching that of the door.  The church's tower rises to a height of  in square tiered stages.\n\nThe church was built in 1844, when the community was at the height of its prosperity, and is one of Berkshire County's finest examples of Greek Revival church architecture.  It was built by a Reformed Methodist congregation as its second sanctuary, the first having been destroyed by fire.  The house was built around the same time as the church as a private residence, and was only acquired for use as a parsonage in 1903. The parsonage is a modest 1-1/2 story gable-front structure, with a single-story ell (a 20th-century addition) extending to the south.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Berkshire County, Massachusetts\n\nReferences\n\nChurches on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts\nChurches in Berkshire County, Massachusetts\nNational Register of Historic Places in Berkshire County, Massachusetts\nTyringham, Massachusetts"

Formation of this RSI army started in 1943 and the army was disbanded in 1945.  Army Group Liguria included several German units and its Italian units were sometimes transferred to German formations.\n\nFormation\nOn 16 October 1943, the Rastenburg Protocol was signed with Nazi Germany and the RSI was allowed to raise four division-sized military formations.

He played the tamburica (prim) and \u0161argija and was the bandmaster of several tamburica orchestras including: Neven, Srbadija, Bratimstvo, Beli Orao and Excelsior.\nThe famous composer and tamburica player from Novi sad issued a \"School for the tamburica\", taught shoemaking, craft printing and carpentry, but since 1890 he was completely devoted to careers as a musician. He has written over 200 songs and instrumental compositions, many of which are considered folk songs. These include but are not limited to: \"\u017dabaljka\", \"Bogata sam, imam svega\" (I am rich, I have everything), \"Dones' mi vina kr\u010dmarice\" (Bring me the wine, bartender), \"Idem ku\u0107i\" (I'm going home), \"Kukuruzi ve\u0107 se beru\" (The corn is already being harvested),\"Kad sam bio mla\u0111an lovac ja\" (When I was a young hunter), \"Neven Kolo\", \"\u0110uvegije gde ste da ste\" (Grooms, wherever you are), \"Majka me psuje\" (My mother curses at me), \"Prolaze no\u0107i\" (The nights go by) and\n\"Bi\u0107e skoro propast sveta\" (Soon the world will collapse), which served as the leitmotif for the cult film \u017dika Pavlovi\u0107, and others ..\nWith the tamburica orchestra of Vasa Jovanovic, Ne\u0161i\u0107 has appeared in most major cities of Europe and became a supporter of Esperanto. He is the founder of Esperanto Society in Novi Sad, which carries his name.\nNe\u0161i\u0107 was a great supporter of the labor movement, when he died on 30 April 1938, just before May Day (International Workers' Day), at his funeral on Alma\u0161ka cemetery in Novi Sad an imposing group of workers gathered with a large number of wreaths as a last salute from the comrades of various labor organisations.\n\nReferences \n\n \"Sa pesmom u narodu\" almanax,Tiski Cvet 2009, Novi Sad\n \"Vojvo\u0111anska tamburica\", Sava Vukosavljev, Matica Srpska 1990.

        "text": "Bill of Rights socialism is the ideology that the United States Bill of Rights advocated for a socialist society or that if need be, a new United States Bill of Rights that explicitly advocated for it should be made. The concept was first coined by Gus Hall, General Secretary of Communist Party USA. Communist Party USA has advocated for amending the United States Constitution to include the right to join a union, the right to a fair-paying job and others.\n\nBill of Rights socialism has also been advocated by the Democratic Socialists of America since 2012.\n\nConcept \n\nIn 2012, the concept was revived by the Democratic Socialists of America, who proposed the following public policies in order to \"achieve basic human social and economic rights\" whose implementation would \"help to achieve freedom and dignity for all Americans\":\n Single-payer healthcare\n Affordable and safe housing\n Universal childcare\n Progressive taxation\n Tuition-free higher education\n Income security\n Leisure time\n Healthy Environment\n Free association\n Cutting military expenditures\n A return to a Keynesian model\n Maximum wage ceilings\n\nCriticism \nThe idea of Bill of Rights socialism has drawn criticism. Writing for the Future of Freedom Foundation, Richard Embley described Franklin D. Roosevelt's Second Bill of Rights and the idea of a socialist United States Bill of Rights as a command economy and \"regulatory socialism\". Other critics argue that socialism is inherently incompatible with the constitutionally enforced federalism in the United States as federalism's separation of powers and decentralization makes technically impossible to achieve the unified and centralized planned economy necessary to supposedly overcome capitalism. Additionally, some American socialists believe that federalism protects established political interests and wish for a constitutional amendment to change it.\n\nSimilarly, about federalism in China, a centralized unitary socialist state, Wu Bangguo, former Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said: \"There will be no separation of powers between the different branches of government and no federal system. It is possible that the state could sink into the abyss of internal disorder [if this happened]\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Bill of Rights socialism by Communist Party USA\n A Social and Economic Bill of Rights by Democratic Socialist of America\n\nConstitution of the United States\nHistory of the Communist Party USA\nLeft-wing politics in the United States\nPolitical movements in the United States\nSocialism in the United States"

However, the parts that still stand display amazing works of sculpture and exquisite carvings.\n\nHistory of the Shahi Qila states that it was originally built by the Farooqui rulers and resided by Shah Jahan, at a time when he was the governor of Burhanpur. Shah Jahan became so fond of the fort that it was here, in Shahi Qila that he establishes his court for the first three years of his ascending the throne. Shah Jahan spent a considerable time in this city, and helped add to the Shahi Qila. Diwan-i-Aam and Diwan-i-Khas were built on the terrace of the Qila.\n \nThe Shahi Qila, Burhanpur is mostly in ruins now, except a few beautifully carved parts of the palace that still stands as a symbol of the glorious Qila it was in the olden days. The locals call the Shahi Qila 'Bhulbhulaya' (that means a labyrinth) because the architecture of the Shahi Qila is puzzling and perplexing for a casual visitor.\n \nThe main attraction at the palace is the hamam or the royal bath. It was specifically built for Shah Jahan's wife, Begum Mumtaz Mahal, so that she could enjoy a luxurious bath in water scented with khus, saffron and rose petals. Hammam Khana was constructed during Mughal Period. The baths bear an inscription of Khan Khana Mirza Abdul Rahim Khana, the famous minister of Akbar and Jahangir. The rooms have domed roof. The Hammam is beautifully decorated with paintings on honey comb work. Even today, the ceiling has many intricate paintings. One of these paintings depicts a monument which is said to have been the inspiration for the Taj Mahal. One of the amazing facts is that the Taj Mahal was originally supposed to have been built at Burhanpur. The site chosen for it still lies vacant near the tapti river. Mumtaz, in whose memory the Taj Mahal was built, died in burhanpur while giving birth to her fourteenth child.\n\nPhoto gallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Burhanpur Historical City\n Burhanpur Gateway to South India\n\n \nForts in Madhya Pradesh\n\nbn:\u09ac\u09c1\u09b0\u09b9\u09be\u09a8\u09aa\u09c1\u09b0\nca:Burhanpur"

In Yoruba (Olatunji's native language) it means, \"Do not worry.\"\n\nThe song featured \"African-derived rhythms and chants\" along with \"swooping orchestration\". In his autobiography, Olatunji said that this was the only song on his first album that he claimed formal ownership of, meaning that it was the only song he received royalties for. American disc jockey Francis Grasso described the song as \"rhythmically sensual\".\n\nMedia\n\nIt has been featured on the Wii playable dance-game, Just Dance.\n\nCover versions\n\nIt has been covered by Serge Gainsbourg, under the title \"Marabout\" and with no credit given to Olatunji, on his Gainsbourg Percussions LP (1964). \nThe song was also covered by James Last on his album Voodoo-Party (1971), by Pierre Moerlen's Gong on their Downwind album (1979), Candido Camero (aka Candido) on his Dancin' & Prancin''' album (1979), by Steve Lee on his album FKW - Jingo (1994) and by Fatboy Slim on his album Palookaville (2004). A cover version was also released by independent dance act the Ravish Brothers (featuring a Hot Funky Daddy Groove) in 1988, in Lightwater, Surrey. The song was also featured in the Hindi serial \"Chandrakanta\" that aired on DD.\n\nIn January 1988 a hit cover version by Jellybean (John Benitez), from his album Just Visiting This Planet'', peaked at no. 12 during a ten-week run on the UK singles chart.\n\nSantana version\n\nThe song was also covered by Santana, on their first album (1969), though Grasso noted this version was not as popular as the original. Spanish journalist Jose Miguel L\u00f3pez stated that when Santana released \"Jingo\" as a single, it was first credited to Carlos Santana. Only years later the credits were corrected. Other multiple editions of Santana's Jingo single, viewable under a Google image search for it, list the composer as A. Copland, evidently confusing this song with Part V. of composer Aaron Copland's \"Statements for Orchestra,\" which is unrelated.\n\nReferences\n\n1959 songs\n1969 debut singles\nSantana (band) songs\nFatboy Slim songs"

        "text": "Galbi-jjim () or braised short ribs is a variety of jjim or Korean steamed dish made with galbi (\uac08\ube44, short rib). Beef galbi is sometimes referred to as \"gari\" (\uac00\ub9ac), so the dish can be called \"garijjim\". Galbijjim is generally made with beef or pork (\ub3fc\uc9c0, dweji) short ribs. In the latter case, it is called dweji galbijjim (\ub3fc\uc9c0\uac08\ube44\ucc1c).\n\nHistory\nIn traditional cuisine, galbijjim was traditionally eaten at Chuseok along with songpyeon, namul, taro soup, chestnut dumplings (\ubc24\ub2e8\uc790), chicken jjim and autumn fruit. As galbijjim is usually made from only the center part of ribs from a calf while the rib ends used to make soup stock, galbi was more expensive than other cuts of beef in South Korea, and has been regarded as a high-class dish.\n\nPreparation and serving\nRibs are cut to size and excess blood should be removed. Knife cuts are made in the meat till the bone to allow seasoning to seep in. Surplus fat is removed from the ribs, either by cutting or removing after parboiling. Soy sauce, sesame oil, scallions, minced garlic, pepper, ground sesame with salt (\uae68\uc18c\uae08), ginger juice, and sugar are mixed together with the ribs and are simmered in a large pot on a mid-flame. The cooking is done slowly, occasionally stirring. When the meat is almost cooked, additional seasoning is added with jujube,  ginkgo nuts, carrots, and pine nuts, and is boiled once again. Chestnuts, shiitake, and seogi mushrooms are added near the end of the dish.\nGalbijjim is usually served in a bowl rather than a plate and was traditionally served in a hap (\ud569, bowl with cover).\n\nGalbijjim by region\nThere is a galbijjim street in the district of Dongin-dong, Daegu, in South Korea. It is known as the original home of hot and spicy galbijjim (\ub9e4\uc6b4\uac08\ube44\ucc1c), as a restaurant owner served the first plate of hot and spicy galbijjim as anju for makgeolli in 1972. The district still maintains its reputation as being the place to go for tasty galbijjim. \n\nJong-galbijjim (\uc885\uac08\ube44\ucc1c) is a variety of pork galbijjim from the Gyeonggi-do region. Pork ribs are marinated in ginger juice, soy sauce, minced garlic, sesame oil, ground sesame with salt, and pepper. The dish is cooked on a high flame and the sauce is reduced accordingly.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n Jjim\n Galbi\n Jorim\n Korean cuisine\n List of steamed foods\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Cooking Video : Kalbi chim at the Embassy of the Republic of Korea\n Baejeob galbijjim recipe  at the Embassy of the Republic of Korea\n Galbijjim recipe\n Galbijjim recipe at AsianSupper\n\nKorean beef dishes\nKorean pork dishes\nSteamed foods"

Both ships built in 1903 were the largest and most luxurious liners built in the United States at the opening of the 20th century.

The ship was in English waters when the United States declared war and made seven wartime round trips. During one of the New York port calls the ship was inspected and accepted for U.S. Navy use assigned the identification number 1614 until the end of hostilities whereupon the armament and naval personnel were removed. \n\nThe Navy chartered Minnesota to bring troops home, renamed the ship Troy and placed her in commission at the Army's Bush Terminal in Brooklyn, N.Y., on 27 February 1919 under the command of Lt.

In 2014, she retired from her 32-year career at HSBC. A qualified barrister at law, during her career Dorner worked in a range of roles in the United Kingdom and internationally. She was the first woman CEO of HSBC, Malaysia.\n\nAs well as being chairman of Control Risks, she is a non-executive director of Rolls Royce and AXA\n\nEducation and career\nDorner attended St Anne's College, Oxford and received an MA in Jurisprudence in 1973.

In 2007, she was appointed deputy chairman and CEO HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad. In 2011, Dorner was appointed to run the US operations of HSBC. At the helm of HSBC during 2013's money laundering scandal, she's said \"One of the things that I am trying to get through to our entire bank is I would rather you walked away from a piece of business that has a question mark next to it than do it in order to boost your bottom line. I am looking for sustainability.\" Dorner retired from HSBC in 2014.\n\nIn 2012, she was named the Most Powerful Woman in Banking by American Banker. In 2013, she was named as one of the 25 Most Powerful Women On Wall Street by Business Insider.\n\nWhile she is now a vocal advocate for advancing women in business and finance, she recognizes that this advocacy could have begun earlier. \u201cI only realized what was happening when I was 50, because there I was, making my way in the unconscious rules,\u201d Ms. Dorner said. \u201cI really do think the next push has got to come from the senior middle-management women who must stand up and be counted on this earlier than I did.\u201d\n\nDorner suffered from ovarian cancer, but after six months of chemotherapy and surgery she became cancer free in 2012.\n\nShe took over as Chairwoman of Virgin Money UK on 31 March 2018. This appointment created the first all-female leadership team at a major British bank, with Jayne-Anne Gadhia acting as chief executive officer.\n\nIn July 2019, it was announced  Dorner will succeed Kevin Beeston as non-executive chair of Taylor Wimpey from 26 February 2020.\n\nReferences\n\n1954 births\nLiving people\nAlumni of St Anne's College, Oxford\nMembers of the Middle Temple\nFellows of St Anne's College, Oxford\n21st-century American businesspeople\n21st-century American businesswomen\nWomen business executives"

A mysterious person warns the court president that somebody wants to kill him, and he sends a telegram to his friend and lawyer, Mr. Graham in London, to come for support. The night before the court session that likely will sentence her, a surprise visitor shows up at night and seemingly provides ample evidence that Mr. Graham, knowing about the terms in the testament, has the intention to take advantage of that, having bought a ticket well before he received the telegram. After making his point that things are not always as they may seem, as simple sleight of hand \"hocuspocus\" tricks and a forged date on a ticket apparently had convinced the judge within minutes that his long-term friend has evil intentions, the visitor declares that he is Peer Bille, a former circus artist and jurist, and that he will defend poor and innocent Mrs. Kjerulf because her lawyer has stepped down.\n\nCast \nCurt Goetz as Peer Bille\nValerie von Martens as Agda Kjerulf\nHans Nielsen as court president\nErnst Waldow as prosecutor\nErich Ponto as Mr. Arthur Graham\nElisabeth Flickenschildt as witness Kiebutz\nJoachim Teege as witness Eunano\nMargrit Ensinger\nMila Kopp\nFritz Rasp as attendant\nTilo von Berlepsch\nFritz Brandt\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Thomas Elsaesser & Michael Wedel.

She was also involved in sexual slavery (known then as \"white slavery\") and child prostitution, often arranging the abduction of children by offering to watch children while parents went to collect luggage or purchase train tickets.\n\nAmong her brothels in Church Street and Kensington as well as a flagellation house in Hampstead, included a \"chamber of horrors\" in Gray's Inn Road where a room was designed for the purposes of sado-masochism as described by journalist William Thomas Stead in a series of articles for the Pall Mall Gazette exposing prostitution in the city during the Eliza Armstrong case. Although never proven, she may have operated a white slave house along the river near Kew, from which women were abducted and smuggled to foreign countries (see Sexual slavery and Human trafficking).\n\nIn 1884, the Alfred Dyer's London Committee obtained evidence of a high class Chelsea brothel operated by Jeffries. An investigation by a former police inspector, who had resigned from the Metropolitan Police when senior officials refused to prosecute her, had been amassing evidence against Jeffries during the year until the London Commission began a private prosecution in March 1885.\n\nAlthough unable to charge Jeffries with any serious offence apart from keeping a disorderly house, the Commission expected much publicity from the case when presenting their evidence. For example, a former housemaid testified that she witnessed an assault on a 13-year-old girl who had been whipped by a belt and raped by a customer.\n\nAppearing in court on May 5, accompanied by several wealthy army officers, Jeffries paid a fine of \u00a3200 after arranging with the court to plead guilty in order to have the evidence against her remain undisclosed. As she left the courthouse, a guard of honour was formed around her by her young escorts.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nMary Jeffries at Probert Encyclopedia\n\n1820 births\n1907 deaths\nEnglish brothel owners and madams\nEnglish criminals\nBDSM people\n19th-century English businesspeople\n19th-century English businesswomen"

It is the second-most heavily populated district on the island and is located on its northwestern coast.\n\nDescription\nTerrain in the district is quite varied with steep ridges and a limited amount of flat ground, as befits the island's volcanic origin. It is mainly rural and lacks any main settlement as there are many small villages dispersed throughout. Its population has fluctuated from 795 in 1998 to 908 in 2008 and 843 in 2016. It trails only Half Tree Hollow District in size.\n\nThe district is named after the Anglican St Paul's Cathedral, which is located there, and also within the district is Plantation House, the Governor's official residence. The island's only secondary school is situated in St Paul's \u2014 the Prince Andrew School.\n\nHistory\nWhen the Dutch East India Company occupied St Helena in December 1672, they made their first landing attempt at Lemon Valley Bay, but were beaten off with boulders and rocks thrown by the defenders from the heights on the sides of the valley. After the English recaptured it in May 1673, the mouth of the Lemon Valley was quickly fortified to better deter any future attempts. By 1717 the fort there was ruinous and a quarantine station was built further up the valley to house the slaves recently received from Madagascar that had smallpox. The fortification in Lemon Valley were allowed to continue to deteriorate until they were replaced by entirely new buildings 50-odd years later.\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nDistricts of Saint Helena\nPopulated places in Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha"

It is intended for the use of cooperatives, their wholly owned subsidiaries, and other organizations that exist to promote or support cooperatives.\n\nThe  TLD was proposed by the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) as a response to the announcement by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) in late 2000 of a phased release of seven new generic top-level domains in an expansion of the Internet domain name space.\n\nThe proposal was backed by many cooperatives and similar trade groups around the world, including the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA). The technical infrastructure for the  TLD was developed by the worker cooperative Poptel in the United Kingdom and became operational on January 30, 2002.\n\nThe domain's sponsoring organization is DotCooperation LLC (also known as dotCoop), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA). DotCooperation is responsible for the TLD operation, including the enforcement of registration requirements. In 2005, the Midcounties Co-operative assumed operation of the domain registry through a subsidiary unit (Midcounties Co-operative Domains).

It is found in the Palearctic,\n\nDistribution\nThe species is widespread in Central and southern Europe. In the North the range extends up to England and Ireland, Denmark, South Sweden and the southern Baltic Sea region. It is found in the West of the Iberian Peninsula. East it extends to Asia minor, the Ukraine, (European) Russia and the Caucasus. It occurs also on the large Mediterranean islands, Corsica (corsula Schawerda, 1929),  Sardinia and Sicily. Earlier reports from North Africa are assigned today to Idaea bigladiata. In the North the species occurs from sea level is to about 500 meters asl. In the Southern Alps it rises 1000 m above sea level, in Corsica up to 2000 m above sea level.\n\nDescription\nThe species has a wingspan of 19\u201322\u00a0mm. The length of the forewings is 9\u201311\u00a0mm. The forewings are relatively wide, the rear edge of the hindwing is slightly concave between the median veins. The ground colour is whitish to light brown. The costa is often greyish brown on the basal half. The wavy crosslines are well developed and they end at the costa as black spots. There are two more wavy lines in the marginal field. Discal marks are almost always present on both fore and hindwings and black. The somewhat stumpy caterpillar is dull smoky brown, marbled and variegated with ochreous, the darker colour most in evidence in front, and the ochreous behind. There an ochreous line along the middle of the dorsum, and one along the region of the spiracles and white spots on rings 5\u20137.\n\nBiology\n\nThe adults fly in one generation from June to August .\n\nThe larvae feed on various types of moss, but also fallen leaves.\n\nIdaea fuscovenosa prefer warm and dry habitats. In the North of the range the species is usually limited to sun-exposed hedge rows, dry forests and forest edges, grassy areas, gardens and uncultivated land.\n\nNotes\nThe flight season refers to the British Isles.

His parents, Marion Henderson and William Pinkney Sr, divorced when he was young. He attended Tilden Technical High School and graduated in 1954.\n\nNavy and later career\nPinkney joined the United States Navy in 1956, serving as a hospital corpsman. He left the Navy in 1964, and moved to Puerto Rico for a few years, where he learned how to sail.\n\nAfter returning to the mainland in 1961, Pinkney worked as a marketing manager for Revlon and later the Johnson Products Company. He started planning to sail around the world in 1985, after being made redundant from his job at the Department of Human Services, and fundraised throughout the late 1980s.\n\nVoyage\nPinkney's voyage around the world lasted 22 months. He traveled approximately . He departed from Boston on August 5, 1990, sailing first to Bermuda, then along the eastern South American coastline, across the Atlantic Ocean to Cape Town, South Africa, across the Indian Ocean to Hobart, Tasmania, across the South Pacific Ocean, around Cape Horn, and up the eastern South American coastline, finally ending up back in Boston.\n\nPinkney sailed on a Valiant 47, a 47-foot cutter named The Commitment.

In the early days of Spectrum Scientific, design and manufacturing was conducted solely by Wiggins with backing and most funding being provided by Don Woodward at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School and the National Institutes of Health.  In 1988, the original Multichannel Data Acquisition system (abbreviated as MAP or \"Harvey box\") was developed and uses hardware filtering of data signals.  The replacement for the MAP, the Omniplex system, was released in 2009 and replaces the hardware filtering components with filtering in software. Due to many contributions like these, Plexon and Harvey Wiggins have become iconic in the neuroscience community.  Dr. Regina Carelli, a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina, describes Harvey as \"wonderful--A scientist much more than a salesman.\"\n\nSpectrum Scientific became known as Plexon in 1996.

He represented Matagorda Municipality in the Convention of 1836 at Washington-on-the-Brazos where he signed the Texas Declaration of Independence.  President Sam Houston nominated Fisher as Secretary of the Texas Navy and the appointment was confirmed by the Senate on October 28, 1836.\n\nA letter to presidential candidate Mirabeau B. Lamar in August 1838 from George Wheelwright urged reconsideration of Fisher for Secretary for the good of the navy and defense of the Republic and Houston suspended Fisher from office in October 1837, to secure \"harmony and efficiency\".  Many in the senate opposed the move and the Senate ordered Fisher's reinstatement on October 18, 1837. This event was a major incident in the early days of the Republic of Texas and added to the severe split between the various factions in the government.\n\nSam Houston Dixon in \"The Men Who Made Texas Free\" wrote that \"when Mr. Fisher died, Richard Ellis, who was president of the convention which declared Texas independent of Mexico, said from the floor of the Senate:  'In the death of Rhodes Fisher the Republic has lost one of its wisest defenders. He was a man of poise even midst times of stress and excitement. Well do some of us remember his cool and deliberate consideration of our acts at Old Washington, March, 1836; how his voice of caution rang out as men of zeal vied with one another in their precipitous rush to complete their labors of establishing a government and returning to their homes. So earnestly did he plead and so logical was his appeal that we were persuaded to follow his advice........There was nothing of the braggadocio about him and he did not lack courage to express his opinions.'\"\n\nFisher died on March 14, 1839, and was buried at Matagorda.

        "text": "4045 Lowengrub, provisional designation , is a dark Alauda asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 32 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 9 September 1953, by astronomers during the Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory in Brooklyn, Indiana, United States. The asteroid was named after American mathematician Morton Lowengrub, dean at Indiana University and one of the fathers of the WIYN Observatory.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nLowengrub is a member of the Alauda family (), a large family of carbonaceous asteroids and named after its parent body, 702\u00a0Alauda.\n\nIt orbits the Sun in the outermost main-belt at a distance of 2.9\u20133.6\u00a0AU once every 5 years and 10 months (2,121 days; semi-major axis of 3.23\u00a0AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 21\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first identification as  at Uccle Observatory in November 1948, almost five years prior to its official discovery observation at Goethe.\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nLowengrub is an assumed C-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period \n\nA rotational lightcurve of Lowengrub was reported in 1996 and obtained from \nphotometric observations by group of French astronomers in the early 1990s. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 9.764 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.40 magnitude ().\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Lowengrub measures between 29.61 and 37.07 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.051 and 0.062.\n\nThe Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and derives a diameter of 32.78 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.17.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after American mathematician Morton Lowengrub, dean, professor and administrator at Indiana University. The naming took place on the occasion of the completion of the WIYN Observatory with its 3.5-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. Lowengrub was instrumental for the planning and construction of the WIYN and was a charter member of the WIYN Board of Governors \n\nLowengrub has authored several books on mathematics including \"Crack problems in the classical theory of elasticity\" (1969) together with Scottish mathematician Ian Sneddon. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 14 May 1995 ().\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info )\n Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\n Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend\n Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center\n \n \n\n004045\n004045\nMinor planets named for people\nNamed minor planets\n19530909"

Dall) The height of the shell attains 3.5\u00a0mm, its diameter also 3.5\u00a0mm. The small, white, solid shell is shaped much like Littorina littorea (Linnaeus, 1758), having 4\u00bd whorls and a minute glassy rounded nucleus. The radiating sculpture consists of fine incremental striae and occasional irregularities of growth. The spiral sculpture consists of two sorts. First, the fine spiral grooving covers the whole shell evenly and is always present. Secondly, there are strong spiral ridges, generally nine or ten on the body whorl, but sometimes smaller and more numerous, sometimes partly absent, sometimes so arranged as to tabulate the part of the whorl next the suture, and almost invariably smaller and weaker as they approach the base and the centre of the base. The suture is distinct, not channelled. The simple aperture is nearly circular, but the outer margin of its thickened edge is angulated at the junction with the body. The callus is continuous. The columella is arched, with a small chink, but no umbilicus behind it. This chink varies in size with different specimens. The aperture is oblique, its upper margin a little depressed. This shell sometimes has the raised riblets reddish brown against the waxen white of the rest.\n\nDistribution\nThis species occurs in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nReferences\n\n Rubio F., Fern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00e9s R. & Rol\u00e1n E. 2013.

He was first mentioned in contemporary sources in 1301, when he was the prince of Tropolje together with his brothers. He was also mentioned as the prince of Trogir in 1305, and of Skradin in 1311. Dissatisfied with the division of powers with his brothers, he led, together with other Croatian nobles, a rebellion against his brother, Mladen II, in a desire to gain further power. After his brother's defeat at the battle of Bliska in 1322, he however failed in his intention to inherit the position paramount power in the family, which went to his other brother, George II.\n\nHe subsequently supported Mladen III in the fight against other nobles and King Louis I, for which he received the administration of Ostrovica from Mladen III. Paul bequeathed Ostrovica to his underage son, George III, to whom he appointed his brother Gregory II as guardian.\n\nHe married the Krk princess Elizabeth Frankopan (Elizabeta Kr\u010dka) (date of birth unknown, died in 1347), with whom he had two sons, George III (also known as George I Zrinski) and Pribko, and daughter Katarina.\n\nIn 1347, Gregory II, in the name of George III, handed over Ostrovica and the Luka County to King Louis I, in exchange for the fort of Zrin and other estates in its vicinity. Both Gregory II and George III moved to Zrin, and the family was since then named after the newly acquired property of Zrin as the Zrinski family. George III was the first who used the name Zrinski.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\n Zrinski\n Frankopan\n\n\u0160ubi\u0107\nSubic\nSubic\nYear of birth missing\n1346 deaths\n13th-century Croatian people\n14th-century Croatian people\nSubic"

        "text": "\"The Runaway Skyscraper\" is a science fiction short story by American writer Murray Leinster, first appeared in the February 22, 1919 issue of Argosy magazine.  Although Leinster had been appearing regularly in The Smart Set and pulp magazines such as Argosy and Short Stories for three years, \"The Runaway Skyscraper\" was his first published science fiction story (or more accurately, scientific romance, since Hugo Gernsback had yet to coin the phrase \"science fiction\").  Gernsback would reprint the story in the third issue of his science fiction pulp magazine Amazing Stories in June 1926.\n\nPlot summary\n\"The Runaway Skyscraper\" concerns Arthur Chamberlain, an engineer who works in a midtown Manhattan office building called the Metropolitan Tower.  When the sun suddenly begins moving backwards in the sky, setting rapidly in the east, he is the only one to realize what is actually happening: a flaw in the rock beneath the building has caused it to subside, but instead of moving in space, the building is falling backwards into the past.  When the subsidence finally ends, the building is located several thousand years in the past, and its 2000-odd inhabitants find themselves stranded in pre-Columbian Manhattan.\n\nChamberlain also realizes that the same seismic forces that caused the building to drop back into the past can also be used to return it to the present, but that doing so will require several weeks of intensive work by the building's inhabitants, and in the meantime they must concentrate on feeding themselves.  Chamberlain convinces the president of a bank on the first floor that he can return them to the present, and together they are able to organize the other inhabitants into hunting and fishing parties.\n\nTwo weeks later, Chamberlain is ready to implement his plan.  He forces a jet of soapy water into an artesian well beneath the building, and this allows the pressure that has built up in the rock to be released.  The building travels forward in time again, returning to the exact moment when it began to travel into the past.\n\nReception\n\nIn 2013, Amazing Stories described it as \"monumental\" and \"an ageless story of adventure and endurance\". Reason noted that the building \"travels backwards in time for no particular reason\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nThe Runaway Skyscraper at Project Gutenberg.\n \n\nScience fiction short stories\n1919 short stories\nWorks originally published in Argosy (magazine)\nWorks by Murray Leinster"

At regional level, he held the British super-flyweight title in 2017. As of June 2020, Edwards is ranked as the world's fifth best active flyweight by BoxRec, fifth by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board and fifth by The Ring. He is the older brother of boxer Sunny Edwards.\n\nEarly life\nEdwards was born on 8 February 1993, in Sutton. He started boxing at the age of 11 as a means to lose weight and it was apparent early on that there existed a bright path for him within the sport if pursued with true commitment . He would then go on to represent the long-standing Repton Boxing Club in London, whilst also getting his brother Sunny into boxing. He grew up being influenced by legendary boxers Sugar Ray Leonard and Manny Pacquiao.\n\nAmateur career\nHe won the 2011 Amateur Boxing Association British light-flyweight title, when boxing out of the Lynn ABC. Three years later in 2014 he won the flyweight title boxing out of Repton ABC.\n\nProfessional career\nEdwards turned professional in 2015, debuting at The O2 Arena with a fourth-round technical knockout win. Edwards compiled a record of 13\u20131, and was ranked #15 by the WBC before shocking and defeating Cristofer Rosales to win the WBC flyweight title. \n\nOn 31 August 2019, Edwards defended his title against Julio Cesar Martinez at the O2 Arena on the undercard of Vasyl Lomachenko vs. Luke Campbell. Martinez came out determined and managed to stop Edwards with 1:43 left in the third round. Edwards was not able to beat the count, and initially Martinez was awarded a knockout victory. After the video replay was shown, it was evident that Martinez had hit Edwards with a body shot with the latter already on the floor with one knee. The fight would therefore be ruled a no contest, with WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman ordering an immediate rematch.\n\nIn October 2019, he announced that he had vacated the WBC flyweight title due to health concerns over making weight at flyweight.\n\nProfessional boxing record\n\nSee also\nList of flyweight boxing champions\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCharlie Edwards Official Website\nCharlie Edwards \u2013 Profile, News Archive & Current Rankings at Box.Live\n\n1993 births\nLiving people\nEnglish male boxers\nPeople from Sutton, London\nFlyweight boxers\nSuper-flyweight boxers\nWorld flyweight boxing champions\nBritish Boxing Board of Control champions\nWorld Boxing Council champions"

The red brick church was built in a rectangular design in 1968 using plans drawn up by the architect Helge Abrahamsen. The church seats about 500 people.\n\nHistory\nFor centuries, the Old Hunn Church served the area surrounding the present-day town of Gj\u00f8vik. In 1882, the old Hunn Church was replaced with a new church in the town of Gj\u00f8vik. This new church was named Gj\u00f8vik Church in honor of the new town. The old name of Hunn was no longer used. Nearly a century later, during the 1960s, the parish began planning for a new church in the Hunndalen valley, just west of the town of Gj\u00f8vik. At this time, the parish decided to bring back the historic name Hunn for the new church, even though it is a new church in a new location with no shared history with the old church. Helge Abrahamsen was hired to design the new, modern brick building. The new church was consecrated on 15 September 1968. The church has a free-standing bell tower.\n\nMedia gallery\n\nSee also\nList of churches in Hamar\n\nReferences\n\nGj\u00f8vik\nChurches in Innlandet\nChurches in Toten Deanery\nRectangular churches in Norway\nBrick churches in Norway\n20th-century Church of Norway church buildings\nChurches completed in 1968\n1968 establishments in Norway"

Yet in the playing of the game, these counters were so easy to use and added such a great visual element to the game that their value could not be questioned.\" The only problem Hickman had with this supplement was that the open-sided tray-type box was no good for subsequent storage of the components. \"Anyone who likes this game is going to quickly find himself with lots of game components and nowhere to store them.\"\n\nNick Davison reviewed James Bond 007 Gamesmaster Pack for Imagine magazine, and stated that \"A comprehensive set of gaming aids of varying degrees of value.\"\n\nIn the November 1984 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #59), Bob Neville called the cardboard figures \"stylish\" and of \"good solid quality\", but he noted the gridsheet \"is too likely to decay quickly since it is on thin paper.\" Neville also noted the lack of a proper box for storage, didn't feel any of this material was really essential, and concluded by giving the supplement a very poor overall rating of only 4 out of 10, saying it was not \"worth the money asked...

She underwent 39 surgeries during a 10-year period. She died by suicide at age 33.\n\nBiography\n\nYounus was a dancer in a red-light district in Pakistan,  when she met her future husband, Bilal Khar, the son of Ghulam Mustafa Khar, who himself is a former Governor and Chief Minister of Pakistan's largest province, Punjab. They were married for three years, with Younus eventually leaving him after she claimed he physically and verbally abused her. She further claimed that he later visited her in May 2000 and poured acid on her, in the presence of her 5-year-old son from a different man.\n\nKhar claimed that the attacker was someone else with his name. He was acquitted of all charges in the incident. Younus was sent to Rome, Italy, for treatment by Tehmina Durrani, Khar's stepmother. Initially she was denied a visa, but under public pressure, she was allowed to leave for Italy. Durrani engaged the Italian cosmetic firm Saint Angelic and Italian government to treat her. Smile Again, an Italian NGO head by Clarice Felli entered Pakistan to assist in the care of mutilated women.\n\nYounus committed suicide by jumping from the sixth floor of a building in  Rome, Italy. Her body was brought back to Pakistan by Durrani, and was wrapped in an Italian and Pakistani flag. The funeral prayer of Younus was held at Edhi home in Kharadar. She is buried at Karachi, Pakistan, in the Defence area.\n\nLegacy\n\nHer attack, trial, and suicide received international attention, and highlighted the plight of acid attacks victims in Pakistan. There were 1,375 acid attacks in the country between 2007 and 2016; or some 153 per year; however only 56% are actually female victims or 85 per year. She was featured in the critically acclaimed documentary film, Saving Face (2012), having been awarded the nation's first Oscar less than a month prior to her suicide. As a result of the awareness she helped raise, acid attacks have continuously fallen.\n\n\"In 2016 and 2017, there were a total of 71 victims of acid attacks, whereas between 2018 and 2019, there were 62 cases related to acid throwing\". Additionally protections have been brought in for women including the very latest Acid and Burn Crime Bill (2017), which \"offers free medical treatment and rehabilitation for acid burn victims, who often face lifelong physical and psychological disabilities\". The film Younus participated in directly helped in such legislation being brought forward and passed by the parliament.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n https://web.archive.org/web/20120326205334/http://images.thenews.com.pk/24-03-2012/ethenews/e-99279.htm\n\n1979 births\n2012 suicides\nPakistani victims of crime\nAcid attack victims\nSuicides by jumping in Italy\nPakistani female dancers\nKhar family\nViolence against women in Pakistan\nPakistani sex workers"

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Templeport and barony of Tullyhaw.\n\nGeography\n\nCavanaquill is bounded on the north by Urhannagh townland, on the west by Munlough South and Lissanover townlands, on the east by Killynaff townland and on the south by Tonyhallagh and Crossmakelagher townlands. Cavanaquill's chief geographical features are a small stream and cow pastures. It is traversed by rural lanes. The townland covers 102 statute acres.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Plantation of Ulster 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as Cavanekilly. The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as Cavancuill. A deed dated 10 May 1744 spells the name as Cavanacull.\n\nAn 1808 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as Cavanagh Hill.\n\nIn the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 4 June 1611, along with other lands, King James VI and I granted one poll of Cavanaquill to Donill Backagh McShane O'Reyly, gentleman. He was a nephew of the O'Reilly Clan chief, Aodh Connallach mac Maolmhordha who ruled from 1565\u20131583. His genealogy is Domhnall Bacach son of Sea\u00e1n son of Maol M\u00f3rdha (d. 1565) son of Sea\u00e1n (d.1516) son of Cathal (d.1467) son of E\u00f3ghan na F\u00e9s\u00f3ige (d.1449).\n\nO'Reilly later sold the land to Walter Talbot of Ballyconnell. Walter Talbot died on 26 June 1625 at Ballyconnell and his son James Talbot succeeded to the Ballyconnell estate aged just 10 years. An Inquisition held in Cavan on 20 September 1630 found that James Talbot was seized of one poll of Cavanickehall, along with other lands. James Talbot married Helen Calvert, the daughter of George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore of Maryland, USA, in 1635. In the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 James Talbot's estate was confiscated because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687. Talbot's land in Cavanaquill was distributed as follows-\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the proprietor as being Lieutenant John Blackforde who also appears as proprietor for several other Templeport townlands in the same survey. His subsequent history can be found under the townland of Bofealan. \n\nThe 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the townland name as Cavan Quill.\n\nThe Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list  twelve tithepayers in the townland.\n\nThe Cavanaquill Valuation Office Field books are available for December 1839.\n\nGriffith's Valuation of 1857 lists five landholders in the townland.\n\nCensus\n\nIn the 1901 census of Ireland, there are two families listed in the townland, and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are still two families listed in the townland.\n\nAntiquities\n\nThe 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state- The remains of an old Danish fort.\n\nThe chief structure of historical interest in the townland is an earthen ringfort.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nThe IreAtlas Townland Data Base\n\nTownlands of County Cavan"

        "text": "Sidney Poitier Black and White: Sidney Poitier's Emergence in the 1960s as a Black Icon is a 2020 biography of Sidney Poitier written by Philip Powers. \n\nPowers is also the author of First Films Directing 1.0, which explores the context and critical opinions of David Cronenberg, Dennis Hopper, Anne Bancroft, Richard Benjamin, Amy Heckerling and Nicholas Meyer's first films.\n\nSummary\nIn this biography, Powers explores Sidney Poitier\u2019s rise to Hollywood success against the backdrop of racial adversity faced by people of colour within the United States. The book incorporates numerous sources, including newspaper articles from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, to provide context and insight into attitudes at the time. It also draws parallels to the racial challenges experienced and spotlighted in the 21st century to emphasise the importance of Poitier\u2019s journey in inspiring black Americans to stand up for their rights. \n\nThe book commences by outlining Poitier\u2019s early life and his beginnings in the film industry, linking the roles he portrayed to his childhood and the lessons instilled in him by his father. Following Poitier\u2019s \u201cprogress as an actor [which] was painfully slow for many years\u201d, a picture emerges of a hard-working Poitier who joined the army, opened a restaurant, worked long hours in the kitchen and considered brick laying and cab driving to make ends meet and later, support his family. Despite the struggle for roles, Poitier was, for the most part, selective in the characters he would portray as he tried to balance \u201cmaking a living as an actor, becoming as popular as a white actor and staying true to a representation of people with dark skin who can do anything a white man can do\u201d.\n\nPowers discusses the barriers faced by Poitier including the lack of representation of black people within films and the subsequent lack of roles, the pressure to sign a loyalty oath in exchange for work, and the political climate in which Poitier\u2019s films were released. The book goes on to explore Poitier\u2019s associations with Stanley Kramer, Spencer Tracy, Martin Luther King and Harry Belafonte and the way in which each of these influenced and shaped his career. The details of these relationships describe the stepping-stones to Poitier\u2019s directorial debut, Buck and the Preacher. Concluding with an analysis of Buck and the Preacher, Powers provides insight into the critical reception of the film and illustrates how the film, often perceived as a flop, marked the beginning of Poitier\u2019s success as a director.\n\nQuotes\n\nReferences \n\nBiography (genre)\nHollywood\nAfrican-American actors\nRacism"

        "text": "Ashburn Alley is the open concourse behind center field at Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies. It is named after Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn, Phillies center fielder from 1948 to 1959, and was also a long time broadcaster for the Phillies from 1963 until his death in September 1997. Ashburn Alley spans from the left field gate to \"The Yard\" kids area, and features a \"street-fair\" like atmosphere before and during a game.\n\nAshburn Alley's name sake began while Ashburn was still playing. During the Phillies playing days at old Shibe Park, Ashburn was known for dropping bunts down the third baseline, which had slightly overgrown grass that helped the ball stay fair. A bronze statue of Ashburn lies in the center of the alley.\n\nFeatures\n\nAshburn Alley serves as a history lesson of baseball in Philadelphia. Granite markers on the walk-way feature every Phillies all-star since the first game in 1933. Another feature of Ashburn Alley is Memory Lane. Memory Lane is located directly behind the batter's eye, and gives an extensive look at the history of Philadelphia baseball. It features the history of the Phillies, the history of Philadelphia Athletics, and history of Negro league teams in the city. At the end of the Memory Lane section offers a great view of the stadiums' two tiered bullpen. The upper bullpen, in particular, pulls snug against the concourse.\n\nOn the western end of the Alley is Bull's BBQ, named after former Phillies slugger Greg \"The Bull\" Luzinski, who also operates it. Bull's BBQ is an outdoor picnic section and serves barbecue pork sandwiches, chicken, and most notably ribs. Luzinski is at most of the games and often socializes with fans.\n\nOn top of the concession buildings in the center of the Alley is the Rooftop Bleachers. This area of the stadium was influenced by the old rooftop seats at the Phillies and Athletics old home Shibe Park. It was common during the 1920s for residents who lived in the rowhouses across from the ballpark to watch the games for free on their rooftops.\n\nThere are many concession stands featuring Philadelphia cuisine staples such as the cheesesteak, at both Tony Luke's and Campo's. The Alley also features the '47 Brand store, which sells classic Phillies apparel, classic pennants and banners, and other items.\n\nReferences\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nSports in Philadelphia"

The resort complex is known commercially as Perisher Ski Resort.\n\nHistory\n\nIndigenous history\nThe Indigenous Australian Ngarigo people first inhabited this area.\n\nEuropean history\nIn the 1830s, Europeans began summer alpine grazing of sheep and cattle. In the 1850s, gold was discovered on the Thredbo River, although finds were not extensive. Early in the 1900s, Eucalyptus delegatensis (alpine ash) trees were logged in this area, the logs brought to a steam-powered mill on the western side of the river by bullock teams.\n\nTrout were introduced into the streams in the early 1900s for sport fishing and this remains a popular pastime and tourist activity for the area.\n\nDr Howard Bullock\nIn the 1930s, Howard Bullock, a medical doctor from Sydney, bought a small parcel of flat land in the Thredbo Valley at the confluence of the Thredbo River and the Little Thredbo River. At that time, Bullock and his family took two days to travel by car to this summer getaway where they enjoyed camping, fishing, bushwalking, and horse riding. \n\nIn 1934, Charles Conway was contracted to build the one-room cottage. It features built-in bunk beds on either side of the main room that has a central fireplace opposite the one door and two small shuttered windows. A separate kitchen building was added in 1938, and the garage and stables in 1947. The cottage area is maintained by the National Parks & Wildlife Service.\n\nLake Crackenback Resort\nAn artificial lake was formed adjacent to the Skitube station around which has been built a holiday resort with chalets for accommodation in both winter and summer. The resort adjoins the Little Thredbo River but the lake is not fed by it. Located on the border of the Kosciuszko National Park, Lake Crackenback Resort is a natural playground nestled in the Thredbo Valley surrounded by the spectacular Snowy Mountains. Lake Crackenback is a perfect base to explore the region from sightseeing, local attractions, snowsports in winter and the many summer activities including walking trails, mountain bikes, canoeing or fishing.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSki Tube\nPerisher Blue\nLake Crackenback resort\n\nSki areas and resorts in New South Wales\nSnowy Mountains"

Including those in the companion Highs in the Mid-Sixties series \u2013 which concentrated on American regional music scenes \u2013 there are over 50 LPs covering some 800 obscure, mostly American \"Original Punk Rock\" songs recorded in the mid-1960s \u2013 primarily known today as the garage rock and psychedelic rock genres \u2013 that were previously known only to a handful of collectors.\n\nTwo similar series of LPs featuring British music were released in the ensuing years, the English Freakbeat series and Electric Sugar Cube Flashbacks series. Although LPs are still available from the Bomp! Records website, none are being manufactured any longer; and many are now out of print, including all of the Freakbeat and Flashbacks discs.\n\nAIP Records also issued numerous CDs in the English Freakbeat series and Pebbles series, with the first 6 Pebbles volumes being basically the same as the LPs, with bonus tracks. The 6th Pebbles album was reissued more appropriately as the 6th CD in the English Freakbeat series, since this LP also featured British music. Most of the later Pebbles CDs were taken from particular regions, like the Highs series. In 2007, AIP Records released the Pebbles, Volume 11 CD as the last of the albums in this landmark series.\n\nAIP Records has begun the Essential Pebbles series, the Planetary Pebbles series, and the You Gotta Have Moxie series. With the exception of an album called New Fruit by Sky Saxon, former leader of the Seeds, all of the AIP releases are in one of these series.\n\nSee also\n List of record labels\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAIP Records mail order site\nAIP Records historical information\n\nRecord labels established in 1983\nAmerican independent record labels\nGarage rock record labels\nReissue record labels"

He briefly attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but did not earn a degree.\n\nIn 1812, Owen was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons and served there for two years; he was later elected to one year in the North Carolina Senate (1819\u20131820). Named to the North Carolina Council of State in 1824, Owen returned to the state senate in 1827 but was elected Governor by the General Assembly in December 1828, narrowly defeating Richard Dobbs Spaight, Jr. in a vote of 96 to 92.\n\nOwen served two consecutive one-year terms as governor, during which he promoted education and served concurrently as President of the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees. He was nominated for a third term as governor, but declined the nomination; that same year, he lost by one vote (to Willie Mangum) a bid to represent North Carolina in the United States Senate.\n\nIn 1835, Owen was a prominent member of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention; there, he supported enfranchisement of land-owning Negro citizens and opposed religious tests for officeholders.\n\nAlthough during his earlier political life, Owen affiliated himself with the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, in 1839, he presided over the first state convention of the emerging Whig Party; three weeks later, he served as president of the National Whig Convention in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Owen was offered the vice-presidential position on the Whig presidential ticket of William Henry Harrison; he turned down the nomination. Had he accepted, Owen might have become President of the United States following Harrison's death early in office instead of John Tyler.\n\nOwen retired to his farm in Chatham County, North Carolina, where he died on October 9, 1841 (Raleigh Register and North-Carolina Gazette, Raleigh, NC, October 19, 1841, page 3, column 5); he is buried in the churchyard of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in Pittsboro, North Carolina.\n\nSources\n \n\n1787 births\n1841 deaths\nAmerican people of Welsh descent\nGovernors of North Carolina\nPeople from Bladen County, North Carolina\nNorth Carolina Democrats\nNorth Carolina state senators\nDemocratic Party state governors of the United States\nNorth Carolina Whigs\n19th-century American politicians"

Gordon served as the head coach of the Texas Southern Tigers from 1969 to 1973.\n\nGordon was born in Abbeville, Mississippi, and was raised in Memphis, Tennessee, where he played basketball at Booker T. Washington High School. The head coach of the Memphis Tigers, Bob Vanatta, told Gordon that Cowboys head coach Henry Iba was prepared to integrate his team and recruited Gordon on behalf of Iba; Gordon committed to play for the Cowboys without visiting the university's campus. As a guard, Gordon had considered himself as an offensive player but was converted to become the team's defensive specialist by Iba and assigned to guard the opponents' best scorers. He suffered from the effects of racism and segregation as the only black player on the Cowboys but credited his teammates with helping to embrace him.\n\nGordon graduated from Oklahoma State University in 1961 with a bachelor of science degree in secondary education. He earned a master's degree in administration and supervision from the University of Memphis and a master's degree in physical education from Texas Southern University.\n\nGordon was named head coach of the Texas Southern Tigers in 1969 after serving as the basketball coach at Carver High School the three previous years. He amassed a 63\u201343 record over four seasons. Gordon resigned as head coach of the Tigers on September 5, 1973.\n\nGordon was honored by Oklahoma State University as the grand marshal of homecoming in 2013 and is a life member of the OSU Alumni Association.

In 1867, Hotchkiss moved to France and set up a munitions factory, first in Viviez, near Rodez, then in Saint-Denis, near Paris, named Hotchkiss et Cie. At about this time, he developed a revolving barrel machine gun (in French: \"canon-revolver\") known as the Hotchkiss gun; the gun was made in four sizes from 37\u00a0mm to 57\u00a0mm, the largest intended for naval use.

Offering free education, it has been described as the \"largest university of the Medieval world\". Ibn Tumart, founder of the Berber Almohad dynasty, reputedly attended the school and studied under al-Ghazali. Nizam al-Mulk's son-in-law Mughatil ibn Bakri was also employed by the school. In 1096, when al-Ghazali left the nezamiyeh, it housed 3000 students. In 1116, Muhammad al-Shahrastani taught at the nezamiyeh. In the 1170s, statesman Beha Ud-Din taught at the nezamiyeh, before he moved on to teach in Mosul.\n\nThe Persian poet Sa'di studied at the nezamiyeh from 1195 until 1226, when he set out on a thirty-year journey. He was also among those who witnessed first-hand accounts of its destruction by Mongol Ilkhanate invaders led by Hulagu during the Sack of Baghdad in the year 1258. Sa'di recalls clearly his days of studies at Al-Nizamiyya in Baghdad: \"A fellow-student at Nizamiah displayed malevolence towards me, and I informed my tutor, saying: 'Whenever I give more proper answers than he the envious fellow becomes offended.' The professor replied: 'The envy of thy friend is not agreeable to thee, but I know not who told thee that back-biting was commendable. If he seek perdition through the path of envy, thou wilt join him by the path of slander.'\"\n\nThe curriculum initially focused on religious studies, Islamic law, Arabic literature, and arithmetic, and later extended to history, mathematics, the physical sciences, and music.\n\nSee also\n Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi\n Nizamiyya\n Mustansiriya School, another Baghdad school, founded in 1233\n Madrasah\n Islamic Golden Age\n\nReferences\nMakdisi, George: \"Madrasa and University in the Middle Ages\", Studia Islamica, No. 32 (1970), pp.\u00a0255\u2013264\n\nSchools in Iraq\nEducation in Baghdad\nEducational institutions established in the 11th century\n11th-century establishments in the Abbasid Caliphate\nBaghdad under the Abbasid Caliphate\n1065 establishments"

The instrument's name derives from \"d\u012b,\" meaning \"low,\" and \"h\u00fa\" (short for huqin).\n\nSizes\nThe instrument comes in three sizes:\nThe xiaodihu (\u5c0f\u4f4e\u80e1, also called dahu or cizhonghu), pitched one octave below the erhu (tuned D-A, with its lowest D one whole step above the viola's lowest C). It is the tenor member of the erhu family (the erhu being the soprano member and the zhonghu being the alto member).\nThe zhongdihu (\u4e2d\u4f4e\u80e1, pitched one octave below the zhonghu, (tuned G-D, as the middle strings of the cello). It is the bass member of the erhu family.\nThe dadihu (\u5927\u4f4e\u80e1, pitched one octave below the xiaodihu and two octaves below the erhu (tuned D-A, with its lowest D one whole step above the cello's lowest C). It is the contrabass member of the erhu family.\n\nOverview\nThe dihu family was developed for orchestral use in the 1930s as lower members of the erhu family (the erhu being the soprano member and the zhonghu being the alto member) to increase the pitch range of the instruments used in a Chinese orchestra and allow music with harmony to be played.  However, by the late 20th century it had largely fallen into disuse, part of the reason being that it is unwieldy to play. Also, the fact that (like other instruments in the huqin family) the bow passes between the instrument's two strings means that playing pizzicato is difficult; thus, the larger four-string gehu and diyingehu (or cello or double bass) are generally used in Chinese orchestras for the lower bowed string voices instead.\n\nSee also\nDahu (instrument)\nDiyingehu\nLaruan\nHuqin\nTraditional Chinese musical instruments\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDihu page (Chinese)\nXiaodihu photo (xiaodihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)\nZhongdihu photo (zhongdihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)\nDadihu photo (dadihu on left; erhu on right for comparison)\n\nBowed instruments\nChinese musical instruments\nDrumhead lutes\nHuqin family instruments"

        "text": "Sacro Cuore di Cristo Re is a Roman Catholic church (minor basilica) in Rome, designed between the 1920s and 1930s by Marcello Piacentini.\n\nHistory \nThe idea for a new church in the newly developed Quartiere della Vittoria (literally District of Victory, named for the victory in World War I) came from Ottavio Gasparri, member of the Sacred Heart of Jesus religious institute. At first the church was to be named Tempio della Pace, to remember and honour the fallen of World War I. Construction began in May 1920. The original design proposed by Marcello Piacentini was inspired by the churches built in Rome in the 16th century.\n\nConstruction halted with the death of Ottavio Gasparri, in 1929. In the next two years Piacentini changed radically the project, being inspired by the emerging Rationalist movement, and the Sacro Cuore di Ges\u00f9 marked the turning point of the sacred architecture in Rome. The construction started again in 1931 and the church was inaugurated in 1934.\n\nThe church became a parish church under Pope Pius XI on 31 October 1926 with the apostolic constitution Regis pacifici. On 5 February 1965 was declared titular church by Pope Paul VI with the apostolic constitution Sacrum Cardinalium Collegium. Later that year, with the motu proprio Recentioris architecturae the church became a minor basilica.\n\nDesign \nThe church has a brick fa\u00e7ade with alternate courses raised and recessed; the fa\u00e7ade is capped with travertine and the doors and windows are framed with the same material. The floor plan, with a central nave of approximately 70 metres in length and flanked by two aisles, is a hybrid of a Latin cross and a Greek cross. The hemispherical dome is 36 metres high and 20 metres in diameter. Over the main portal there is a high relief by Arturo Martini depicting the sacred heart of Jesus. Around the interior are the Stations of the Cross in bronze by Alfredo Biagini.\n\nReferences \n\n  Luigi Monzo: trasformismo architettonico \u2013 Piacentinis Kirche Sacro Cuore di Cristo Re in Rom im Kontext der kirchenbaulichen Erneuerung im faschistischen Italien, in: Kunst und Politik.

He also served as Duke of Cieszyn.\n\nBorn in Vienna on 8 September 1633, and baptised as Ferdinand Franz,  Ferdinand IV was the eldest son of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor and his first wife Maria Anna, the daughter of Philip III of Spain. At a young age, Ferdinand IV took his father's role as Archduke of Austria. In 1646, Ferdinand IV became King of Bohemia as he shared the role with his father Emperor Ferdinand III. He was crowned on 5 August 1646, and also shared the role of Duke of Cieszyn with Ferdinand III. Ferdinand IV also shared the role as King of Hungary and Croatia with his father; his coronation took place on 16 June 1647 in Pressburg, present-day Slovakia.\n\nAfter the French attempted to modify the system of the election of King of the Romans, Emperor Ferdinand III made an opportunity of a recent decline in the prestige of France, and was able to install Ferdinand IV as King of the Romans, and de facto heir to the Holy Roman Empire. He was crowned in Ratisbon (Regensburg, present-day south-east Germany) on 18 June 1653 after gaining the position on 31 May 1653. However, Ferdinand IV unexpectedly died of smallpox in Vienna on 9 July 1654, and was later succeeded by his brother Leopold I as King of the Romans. Prior to his death, it was planned that he would marry Philip IV of Spain's daughter Maria Theresa of Spain, his cousin. Upon the death of Ferdinand III, Leopold I was elected as Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nAncestors\n\nReferences\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1633 births\n1654 deaths\n17th-century Kings of the Romans\nHabsburg kings of Bohemia\nKings of Hungary\nDukes of Teschen\nKnights of the Golden Fleece\nNobility from Vienna\nDeaths from smallpox\nBurials at the Imperial Crypt\n17th-century House of Habsburg\nHeirs apparent who never acceded"

        "text": "\"Poor Little Fool\" is a song written by Sharon Sheeley and first recorded by Ricky Nelson in 1958.\n\nBackground\nSheeley wrote the song when she was 15 years old. She had met Elvis Presley, and he encouraged her to write. It was based on her disappointment following a short-lived relationship with Don Everly of The Everly Brothers. Sheeley sought Ricky Nelson to record the tune. She drove to his house, and claimed her car had broken down. He came to her aid, and she sprang the song on him. Her version was at a much faster tempo than his recording.\n\nThe song was recorded by Ricky Nelson on April 17, 1958, and released on Imperial Records through its catalog number: 5528. The recording features the background vocals of the Jordanaires.  On August 4, 1958, it became the first number-one song on Billboard magazine's then-new Hot 100 chart, replacing the magazine's Jockeys and Top 100 charts. It spent two weeks at the number-one spot. It also reached the top 10 on the Billboard Country and Rhythm and Blues charts. Following its success, Sheeley worked with Eddie Cochran.\n\n\"Poor Little Fool\" became a radio hit when it was released as part of a four-song extended-play 45 rpm disc, which was excerpted from the artist's second LP, Ricky Nelson. Responding to the buzz, Lew Chudd, the founder and head of Imperial Records, rushed out a single version (on both 45 and 78 rpm). Nelson objected, however, believing that the move would hurt sales of the EP. Under his contract with Imperial, the singer had approval rights for all picture-sleeve art, so to express his displeasure with Chudd's decision, he chose not to select a photograph for the \"Poor Little Fool\" single. As a result, \"Poor Little Fool\" was the only Ricky Nelson single released by Imperial to be issued in the United States without a photo in a plain-label, cut-out sleeve.\n\nCharts\n\nOther versions\nThe \"Dodgers\" and Johnny Angel released a cover version of the song in 1958 on Skyway 45-119-AA. \nThe Fleetwoods recorded it in 1962.  \nTerry Black released a version of the song in 1965 on his debut album, Only 16, and it reached number six in Canada.\nFrank Mills released a version in 1972 in Canada.

Trouser Press described the album as a \"horrendously wrongheaded comeback bid that shows the Waves to be utterly oblivious to their own strengths,\" calling it \"bland, overprocessed commercial slop.\" The Rolling Stone Album Guide felt that the writing was \"empty and mannered.\" Rew was quoted on the website saying, \"We've never been successful enough to be immune from the influences of producers and marketing men ... the more we fell for those 80s trademarks, the more we diluted the band.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nKatrina and the Waves\nKatrina Leskanich \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar\nKimberley Rew \u2013 lead guitar, vocals, keyboards\nVince de la Cruz \u2013 bass, additional guitars, vocals, keyboards\nAlex Cooper \u2013 drums, vocals, keyboards\nAdditional musicians\nNick Glennie-Smith \u2013 additional keyboards\nStevie Lange \u2013 backing vocals\nShirley Lewis \u2013 backing vocals\nDee Lewis \u2013 backing vocals\nJimmy Helms \u2013 backing vocals\nGeorge Chandler \u2013 backing vocals\nJimmy Chambers \u2013 backing vocals\nTechnical\nKatrina and the Waves \u2013 producer\nJay Burnett \u2013 additional production, engineer, mixing\nStephen Stewart \u2013 engineer  \nMark Sayer-Wade \u2013 engineer \nMike Vindice \u2013 additional engineer \nDennis Herman \u2013 additional engineer \nPat Collier \u2013 additional engineer \nSarah Jarman \u2013 assistant engineer \nSimon Lee \u2013 assistant engineer  \nVicente Roix \u2013 assistant engineer  \nNigel Green \u2013 mixing \nPaul Cox \u2013 front cover photography\nRobin Emilien \u2013 back cover photography\n\nCharts\n\nSingles\n\nNotes \n\nKatrina and the Waves albums\n1989 albums\nSBK Records albums\nAttic Records albums"

        "text": "St Andrew's Church, Chesterton is a Church of England parish church in Chesterton, Cambridge. It is a Grade I listed building. A church was first recorded on this site around 1200. The church was presented in 1217 to the papal legate, Cardinal Guala, by Henry III of England, in gratitude for the legate's attempt at reconciliation during domestic unrest at the end of the reign of King John. In 1436 Henry VI seized ownership of the church and associated buildings from the Italian Abbey of Vercelli and gave it to King's Hall, Cambridge which later became Trinity College, Cambridge. Trinity College is the church's patron to this day; with many vicars of Chesterton being fellows of Trinity.\n\nBuilt from flint, rubble and clunch with ashlar on the tower and buttresses. The tower has two bell-openings (decorated) and is topped by a spire lit by small windows. The spire was restored in 1847 and the spare, tower and chancel in 1968.  The windows are in the perpendicular style, except the  easternmost window in the south aisle which is decorated.\n\nThe interior has an aisled nave with arcades of seven bays, each with octagonal piers dating from the 14th century on each side there is a clerestory dating from the 15th century. Above this lies the roof is supported by stone corbels, and below the floor is laid with polychromatic tiles. The church is lit via stained glass dating from the 19th century. There is a 15th-century Doom painting above the chancel arch.\n\nOutside, the graveyard is of interest and is listed. On the church's north wall, a plaque to Anna Maria Vassa (died 1797), eldest daughter of the former slave and anti-slavery campaigner Olaudah Equiano, commemorates a link with the abolition of the  slave trade.  \n\nNearby are the Old Manor House to the south, the vicarage (1820) to the east and Chesterton Tower is a little further away just off Chapel Lane.\n\nReferences\n\nAndrew's Church, Chesterton\nGrade I listed buildings in Cambridge"

Later the family moved to Herrenberg by Stuttgart, where Mulert earned his high school diploma in 1958. Afterwards he served four years in the German Military. From 1962 to 1967 he studied economics at the Rheinischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t in Bonn. Afterwards he went to Fort Collins with a Fulbright Scholarship to Colorado State University, and he extended his stay with a Teaching Assistant position and earned his Ph.D. in Economics in 1972.\n\nProfessional career \nIn 1973 the family moved to Heidelberg where Mulert taught Business Administration. His research focussed on the role of Robert Bosch as social entrepreneur. From 1975 to 1986 he was in charge of the German Program Unit at the German American Fulbright Commission in Bonn, in 1975/76 and 1980/81 Mulert served as Acting Director General. In 1987, Mulert moved to Frankfurt to work at the City University. In 1991, he founded the \"Institut f\u00fcr Internationale Studien\" in Erfurt, as well as the \u2018Verein zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandskontakten\u2019 in 1993. Both  organizations aimed at improving intercultural communication.\n\nGerman Fulbright Alumni Association \nMulert was the initiator of the first Fulbright Alumni Association outside the US, based in Frankfurt, Germany. He inspired hundreds of former grantees, so that on January 24, 1986, the founding documents of the German Fulbright Alumni association were signed. The association nowadays has appr. 1.300 members from 30 countries.\n\nLegacy \nAs a former Fulbright Fellow, he believed in Senator J. William Fulbright's idea of \"waging peace through understanding\". Professionally, he supported thousands of students and professors before, during and after their academic exchange from and to the USA. In his personal life, he tirelessly campaigned for an improvement of transatlantic relations.\n\nMulert Award \nSince 2010, the annual \"Juergen Mulert Memorial Award on Mutual Understanding\" is granted to current or former participants of the Fulbright Program.

The book was first published by Uptone Press in Milwaukie, Oregon in 2005, with a later re-release by the author in 2017.\n\nPost Traumatic Slave Syndrome\nExpanding on a hypothesis of \"post-traumatic slavery syndrome\" by psychiatrist Alvin Francis Poussaint and journalist Amy L. Alexander, DeGruy wrote in her 2001 doctoral thesis that African Americans \"sustained traumatic injury as a direct result of slavery and continue to be injured by traumas caused by the larger society's policies of inequality, racism, and oppression.\" This is summed up in Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome as:\n\nIn the book, DeGruy argues that PTSS is a result of unresolved post-traumatic stress disorder arising from the experience of slavery, transmitted across generations down to the present day, along with the stress of contemporary racial prejudice (e.g. via racial microaggressions). This manifests as a psychological, spiritual, emotional, and behavioral syndrome that results in a lack of self-esteem, persistent feelings of anger, and internalized racist beliefs.\n\nDeGruy states that PTSS is not a disorder that can simply be treated and remedied clinically but rather requires profound social change in individuals, as well as in institutions, that continue to reify inequality and injustice toward the descendants of enslaved Africans.\n\nThe theory has been generative of subsequent academic work in clinical psychology and black studies.\n\nReception\nIn addition to forming the basis of public lectures and workshops offered by DeGruy and her contemporaries, the research described in Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome inspired an eponymous play, which was staged at the Henry Street Settlement Experimental Theater, New York, in 2001.\n\nCritical scholars say that the PTSS hypothesis pathologizes African Americans and is itself racist.\n\nSee also \n Historical trauma\n Sociology of race and ethnic relations\n Weathering hypothesis\n\nReferences\n\n2005 non-fiction books\nNon-fiction books about American slavery\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\nAfrican-American history\nLiterature by African-American women\nAfrican-American studies publications"

Its stability and relative nontoxicity allows it to be used as a detergent and emulsifier in a number of domestic, scientific, and pharmacological applications. As the name implies the ethoxylation process leaves the molecule with 20 repeat units of polyethylene glycol; in practice these are distributed across 4 different chains, leading to a commercial product containing a range of chemical species.\n\nFood applications\nPolysorbate 20 is used as a wetting agent in flavored mouth drops such as Ice Drops, helping to provide a spreading feeling to other ingredients like SD alcohol and mint flavor.\n\nThe World Health Organization has suggested acceptable daily intake limits of 0\u201325\u00a0mg of polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters per kg body weight.\n\nBiotechnical applications\nIn biological techniques and sciences, polysorbate 20 has a broad range of applications.

        "text": "The Daycroft School was a co-educational private boarding school founded in 1928. Initially located at a private home in Darien, Connecticut, it relocated to Stamford in 1935, and in 1963, to the neighboring town of Greenwich, Connecticut. Relocating again in Greenwich, it eventually occupied the Rosemary Hall campus from 1971 until Daycroft's closing in 1991. Smart founded the school for the children of local Christian Scientists.\n\nSchool history \nDaycroft was founded by Sarah Pyle Smart as a private school for the children of area Christian Scientists so they could be educated in an environment akin to their home life, where the teachings of Christian Science were \"an integral part\" of life. To that end, the faculty were all members of The Mother Church. Admission to the school was restricted to the children of parents who were students of Christian Science. The school had no official tie with the Christian Science Church. In later years, admission was extended to those had a close relative who was a member of The Mother Church or one of its branch churches.\n\nThe school was a member of the Secondary Education Board and offered pre-school through high school, in general subjects and college preparatory education. The school offered partial scholarships and was incorporated in 1939 as a non-profit institution.\n\nThe school's initial home was in Darien, Connecticut, where the Smarts lived. In 1935, a portion of an estate was purchased on Noroton Hill, near the  Stamford Cove and became the new home for the school. The 46-acre Stamford campus was sold to Clairol in 1963, when the school moved to the Rock Ridge area of Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1971, the school moved to the former Rosemary Hall campus, also in Rock Ridge. In 1998, the campus was placed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its architectural significance. Its chapel was designed in the Middle English Gothic style by Theodore E. Blake of Carr\u00e8re & Hastings.\n\nPolio outbreak \nIn 1972, the Daycroft school was one of the last sites of a polio outbreak in the United States. Due to their Christian Science belief, very few students at the school were immunized for polio. The outbreak prompted an emergency quarantine and mass immunization, which successfully prevented polio from spreading to the rest of the state. Ultimately, at least 11 school children (9 boys and 2 girls) were stricken by the paralytic form of the disease.\n\nNotable alumni and staff \nRichard Bergenheim\nJacqueline Moss\nZack Snyder\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDaycroft School Foundation\nCS e-News Spotlight\n\nSchools in Fairfield County, Connecticut\nGreenwich, Connecticut\nChristian Science in the United States\nChristian Science in Connecticut\nFormer Christian Science churches, societies and buildings in the United States\nEducational institutions established in 1928\n1928 establishments in Connecticut"

The ship's construction was completed in July 2019 and it commenced operations a month later, joining the two Canarian capitals, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife, in just over an hour and a half. The short journey time not only gives Armas a competitive edge in sea transport between the two islands, but also allows it to compete with flights.\n\nName\nVolc\u00e1n de Tagoro follows the usual Naviera Armas naming convention, consisting of '' (Spanish for 'volcano') followed by a name starting with the letter T.

        "text": "Pocket Trains is a business simulation video game developed by NimbleBit for iOS and Android.  It was published on the App Store on 15 September 2013 for iOS.\n\nGameplay \n\nSimilar to Pocket Planes, the game focuses on running a transportation network system. The player starts with small steam trains of limited fuel and speed that can carry a small amount of cargo, and/or passenger cars. Earning coins from delivering jobs, the player slowly expands their rail network to include more cities and better trains. Like Pocket Planes, Pocket Trains uses real cities around the world and has quasi-realistic costs to purchase tracks and cities relative to the real world.\n\n\"Jobs\" are single delivery tasks offered to trains. They are priced based on the distance from the originating station to the destination. Although multiple jobs may be headed to the same destination, different types of jobs may be more profitable than others. Jobs can be held at stations for transfer between trains or for later transport.\n\nCertain jobs involve the delivery of \"Crates\", which are placed into the player's inventory upon delivery. Crates can be opened using the second currency 'Bux' and contain parts for trains that can be built once all the necessary components are achieved.\n\nThere are also special jobs that earn the player a secondary in-game currency called \"Bux\". This currency can be used to buy coins, allow more jobs to be held in yards at stations, speed up trains, and open crates. Bux can also be purchased with money.\n\nCrates, Coins and Bux can also be received by watching the train travel screen, and tapping on the resources as they pass by.\n\nReception \n\nPocket Trains has been received well by critics. Metacritic described it as a \"fun ride\", giving it an aggregated score of 76/100. Toucharcade rated it 4.5 out of 5 stars, saying it was \"yet another fun title\" when comparing it to Pocket Planes. Gamezebo also rated it 4.5/5 stating it was a \"charming, highly addictive\" game. Pocket Gamer rated it 7/10, calling it an \"impressively simple time-waster\", but noting that it \"is a little too similar to its airborne predecessor\", referring to Pocket Planes. However, Edge Online rated it 5/10, complaining \"expansion is painfully slow\".\n\nSee also \nPocket Planes\nPocket Frogs\nNimbleBit\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n NimbleBit's official website\n\nSimulation video games\n2013 video games\nAndroid (operating system) games\nIOS games\nVideo games developed in the United States"

Williams House is prominently sited, standing just beyond the eastern end of Taunton's Plain Street Bridge across the Taunton River, on a triangular parcel bounded by Plain, Water, and Berkley Streets. It is a large -story brick building, with a side-gable roof pierced by two gabled dormers and a central brick chimney stack. The facade facing toward the bridge is eight bays wide, evenly spaced and all filled with sash windows that have granite sills and lintels. The entrances are on the side facades, facing toward Berkley and Plain Streets; these are five bays wide, with the entrances at the centers, framed by paneled surrounds. A five-bay two-story brick ell extends to the main block's rear.\n\nThe house was built circa 1830, when the Weir Village area where it stands was a thriving seaport and industrial area. It is one of Taunton's only brick Greek Revival houses, was probably built by Francis Williams, member of a prominent local family involved in sea trade.

He went on to the University of Leiden, applying himself specially to Hebrew and the cognate tongues. His thesis Dissertatio theologico-philologica de utilitate linguae Arabicae in interpretenda sacra lingua (\"The Use of Arabic in the Interpretation of Scripture\") appeared in 1706. After a visit to Reland in Utrecht, he returned to Groningen (1708); then, having taken his degree in theology (1709), he returned to Leiden, and devoted himself to the study of the manuscript collections there until 1711, when he became pastor at Wassenaer.\n\nHe disdained parochial work and decided to accept the Hebrew chair at Franeker in 1713. He held this position until 1729, when he was transferred to Leiden as rector of the collegium theologicum, or seminary for poor students. From 1732 until his death (at Leiden) he was professor of Oriental languages at Leiden.\n\nSchultens was the chief teacher of the Arabic language in the whole of the Europe during his lifetime. In some sense, he revived Arabic studies. He differed from J. J. Reiske and Silvestre de Sacy in regarding Arabic as a handmaid to Hebrew. Reiske considered Schultens' treatment of Arabic to be of little value, also maintaining that Arabic studies should not be taught as part of theology, but as a subject matter in its own right, as was mathematics, physics, geography and medicine. Schultens vindicated the value of comparative study of the Semitic tongues against those who, like Jacques Gousset, regarded Hebrew as a sacred tongue with which comparative philology has nothing to do.\n\nHis principal works were Institutiones ad Fundumenta Lingu\u00e6 Hebraic\u00e6 (1737), Origines Hebraeae (2 vols., 1724, 1738), a second edition of which, with the De defectibus linguae Hebraeae (1731), appeared in 1761; Job (1737); Proverbs (1748); Vetus et regia via hebraezandi (1738); and Monumenta vetustiora Arabum (1740).

He was the son of Henrik Horn (1578-1618) and was born two months after the father's death. During his youth, the city of Stade came under the rule of Sweden possession in 1628. Stade was held by the Danish from 1636 until reverting to Swedish control in 1643. Horn received a military education and pursued a military career in the service of the Royal Swedish Army. At the age of 25, he was appointed Colonel. Horn became Major General in 1654, General Lieutenant and Chief of the Finnish Army in 1657 and Field Marshal in 1665. He distinguished himself in the Polish campaign and in 1666 was appointed Governor-General of Bremen-Verden which was under a Personal union with Sweden from \u20131712.\n\nAs Governor-General he commanded Swedish forces in 1675/76 against the allied German armies during the Bremen-Verden Campaign, but eventually had to surrender. He was given the command of the Royal Swedish Navy in 1677 and was made a member of the Privy Council of Sweden (riksr\u00e5d).

The brick townhouse, built c. 1806, is notable as the home for many years of Charles Sumner (1811\u20131874), an outspoken and aggressive political opponent of slavery, whose beating on the floor of the United States Senate in 1856 was a defining moment of the pre-American Civil War period. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Sumner is a four-story townhouse, faced in brick, which was built c. 1806. The interior has a typical side hall plan, with a front parlor, behind which are a sitting room and kitchen. Its upper floors have similar arrangements of rooms. The house was Charles Sumner's home for thirty years.\n\nCharles Sumner was born to abolitionist parents, and was educated at Harvard College, where he studied law under Joseph Story. Sumner became politically active in the fight against slavery in the 1840s, when he also gained a reputation as an orator. He helped found the abolitionist Free Soil Party in 1848, under whose banner he won election to the United States Senate in 1851. This marked the beginning of a more vocal and aggressive opposition to slavery in the political halls of Washington, D.C. His searing verbal reprobation of his opponents escalated into violence when he was beaten unconscious on the floor of the Senate by South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks in 1856, an event that emotionally polarized the country. After Sumner's recovery, he returned to the Senate, where he played a leading role as a Radical Republican during the American Civil War, as an advocate of emancipation. After the war he championed civil rights for free slaves during the Reconstruction Era, and played a role in the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.\n\nThe house was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\n\nImages\n\nSee also\n List of National Historic Landmarks in Boston\n National Register of Historic Places listings in northern Boston, Massachusetts\n\nReferences\n\nHouses completed in 1806\nNational Historic Landmarks in Boston\nHouses in Boston\nBeacon Hill, Boston\nHistoric district contributing properties in Massachusetts\nHouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Suffolk County, Massachusetts\nNational Register of Historic Places in Boston\nSumner family"

        "text": "Arredondo, Florida is an unincorporated community in Alachua County, about seven miles southwest of Gaineville on the highway from Gainesville to Archer. It was established as a shipping station on the Florida Railroad that ran from Fernandina through Gainesville to Cedar Key, largely absorbing an earlier community called Kanapaha. The Florida Railroad later became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which abandoned the line from Archer to Cedar Key in 1932. The tracks were removed in the 1970s. \n\nThe name of the community comes from the Arredondo Grant, a Spanish land grant that includes much of Alachua County and parts of Levy and Marion counties. A post office opened in Arredondo in 1873 and remained in service until 1925.\n\nThe area around Arredondo was used to raise cattle in the middle of the 19th century, and some cattle-raising continued into the 1880s.  In the 1850s, cotton growers from South Carolina established plantations, including the Haile Homestead, in the area, which was then called Kanapaha. The soil around Arredondo is fertile, with underlying deposits of phosphate rock contributing to the fertility. After the Civil War, the cotton planters and newcomers to the area turned to vegetable, fruit and tree-nut production. In the 1883 season, 80,000 crates of vegetables were shipped from the Arredondo station. Strawberries shipped to New York in early February sold for $3.00 a quart.\n\nFarmers began experimenting with the commercial production of tomatoes in the area of Arredondo in 1870. In 1872,  were planted to tomatoes, and Arredondo became the center of tomato-growing in Florida. Tomatoes were a profitable crop. In 1882, Florida tomatoes sold for $4.00 to $4.50 per bushel crate in Chicago. As railroads extended further south in Florida, tomato-growing also moved south, permitting an earlier harvest for shipment to the north. Commercial tomato growing, and commercial vegetable growing in general, had ceased in the area around Arredondo by 1900.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nUnincorporated communities in Alachua County, Florida\nUnincorporated communities in Florida"

It then continues north to Lake Eufaula Dam, and then turns east to end at State Highway 2. It has no lettered spur routes.\n\nRoute description\n\nState Highway 71 begins at SH-31 on the west side of Quinton in northeast Pittsburg County. The highway initially follows the Quinton street grid, which takes it in a north-northwest direction. As the grid peters out on the outskirts of town, SH-71 breaks away to the west and then to the northwest to avoid Beaver Mountain, gradually curving around to a northerly heading as it approaches the county line. The route crosses into Haskell County about three miles north of Quinton.\n\nThe road continues north in Haskell County until it veers northeast and crosses Longtown Creek. The road then turns back north, passing through rural parts of the county. SH-71 intersects SH-9 in the unincorporated community of Enterprise, just over five miles (8\u00a0km) north of the Pittsburg\u2013Haskell county line.  North of Enterprise, SH-71 parallels Brooken Creek until it drains into Lake Eufaula. The highway serves the boat docks and campgrounds on the east side of the lake, which is the largest entirely within Oklahoma. SH-71 then runs across the dam impounding the lake, bringing it into McIntosh County.\n\nSH-71 merely cuts across the southeast corner of McIntosh County; the highway spends only  within its boundaries. It soon enters Muskogee County, now on an eastbound trajectory. The road runs through the Canadian River valley, staying between the river and Hi Early Mountain. The route next turns northeast, away from the river but still skirting the mountain's base. It finally comes to an end at SH-2 about  south of Porum.\n\nHistory\n\nJunction list\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSH-71 at OKHighways\nSH-71 at Roadklahoma\n\n071\nTransportation in Pittsburg County, Oklahoma\nTransportation in Haskell County, Oklahoma\nTransportation in McIntosh County, Oklahoma\nTransportation in Muskogee County, Oklahoma"

        "text": "Armenian needlelace (also known as Bebilla, Nazareth Lace and Knotted Lace) is a pure form of needle lace made using only a needle, thread and pair of scissors.\n\nHistory\nLike lacis, or filet lace, Armenian needlelace seems to be an obvious descendant of net making. Where lacis adds decorative stitches to a net ground, Armenian needlelace involves making the net itself decorative.\n\nThere is some archeological evidence suggesting the use of lace in prehistoric Armenia and the prevalence of pre-Christian symbology in traditional designs would certainly suggest a pre-Christian root for this art form.\n\nIn contrast to Europe where lace was the preserve of the nobility, in Armenia it decorated everything from traditional headscarves to lingerie and lacemaking was part of many or most women's lives.\n\nTechnique\nThe lace is made by tying knots, usually tied onto the previous round of the piece creating small loops of thread onto which the next round of knots can be tied. Patterns are created by varying the length of the loops, missing loops from the previous round, adding extra loops and similar.\n\nWhen used as an edging the lace can be made directly onto the hem of the fabric being edged. When a doily or freeform object (such as the birds and flowers decorating traditional headscarves) is being started a series of loops is tied onto a slip knot which is pulled tight to complete the first round.\n\nSee also\nList of fabric names\n\nReferences\n\nSpecific\n\nNeedle lace\nArmenian art\nArmenian culture\nTextile arts of Armenia"

        "text": "Urs\u00e4kta r\u00f6ran (vi bygger om) () was a Swedish television programme that was broadcast on TV4 in 2002. It was Filip Hammar and Fredrik Wikingsson first success and was the show that brought them to fame. The concept involved Filip and Fredrik making fun of both famous and unknown people using a hidden camera and similar setups. The jokes were of a rather unusual, sometimes experimental, nature and some viewers took offense, feeling that the pair were humiliating innocent people.\n\nThe show made the headlines due to a segment called \"the Swedish Nazi-reference championship\" where they fooled singer and former Expedition Robinson-star Emma Andersson into an interview where they made as many Nazi-references as possible and observed her reactions. This included jokes such as naming the show they claimed to work for \"Treblinka\", claiming that Leni Riefenstahl was a modern director of music-videos, that Joseph Goebbels was a DJ whose music resembled Andersson's, and dozens of other references to the Third Reich and the Holocaust. Throughout the interview, Andersson wore a T-shirt with the text \"Treblinka - Class of '45\". Andersson didn't seem to react at all on tape. She later claimed that her reactions were edited out in order to make fun of her - a claim Fredrik Wikingsson has later refuted.\n\nThis caused a major controversy as many felt that the whole concept was mean-spirited and in bad taste. Tabloids reported the segment as a scandal and painted Andersson as a violated victim. Filip and Fredrik defended the segment by claiming that it is important to expose ignorance among public persons who young people might look up to. In the end, TV4 was fined by the Granskningsn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r radio och TV, who argued that, since Andersson was not a political person, the segment was intrusive to her privacy and integrity.\n\nIn a similar vein, the pair staged an interview with an openly homophobic priest, only to kiss each other in front of him in the middle of the interview.\n\nReferences\n\nTV4 (Sweden) original programming\nSwedish comedy television series"

There are two extensions, OCBC Centre South and OCBC Centre East. There is an Executive Club on one of the higher floors of the building. OCBC Centre East has food and beverage outlets.\n\nHistory \nOCBC Centre was the result of the second Sale of Sites of the Urban Renewal Department of the Housing and Development Board in 1968.  The building was designed by I. M. Pei & Partners (now Pei Cobb Freed & Partners) together with now defunct BEP Akitek (Pte) Singapore and started construction in 1975. Its construction period was only two years due to a three-tier system. The building was completed on 1 October 1976 and was Southeast Asia's tallest building at the time. A bronze sculpture designed by Tan Teng Kee sat at the building until 1983 when it was moved to the now defunct Bras Basah Park. Large Reclining Figure, a large bronze sculpture by Henry Moore, replaced it in 1984, and a new plaza and reflecting pool were built outside the front entrance of the building. The building has undergone several modernisations and OCBC Centre East and South was constructed at a later date.\n\nArchitecture\nThe building is an example of Brutalist architecture, a popular architectural style in the 1970s.\n\nIt is designed to be a symbol of strength and permanence, and its structure consists of two semi-circular reinforced concrete cores as well as three lateral girders which helped make construction faster. The building is divided into three sections due to the steel trusses being  constructed off-site and were put into position. Each section consists of floors that are cantilevered 6 metres from each column, with load transfer girders spanning at each end taking up boxed sections of the pre-stressed concrete. Lattice steel models strengthened by steel and  concrete compression was installed on the 20th and 35th floors of the building. The building has been nicknamed \"The Calculator\" due to its flat shape and windows which look like button pads.\n\nSee also \n List of tallest buildings in Singapore\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1976 establishments in Singapore\nBrutalist architecture in Singapore\nDowntown Core (Singapore)\nI.
