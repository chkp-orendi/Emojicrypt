Additionally, the second text includes an irrelevant phrase (\"A quick brown fox jumps over a lazy cpdogow\") that does not contribute to the technical content. Therefore, the criteria for changing technical terms to emojis were not met at all.",
                "answer_metric reasoning": "$ANSWER: 0.9\n\nBoth texts discuss the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline and its benefits to the software development lifecycle. They cover similar key points such as automation of integration and deployment processes, faster and more reliable releases, reduced manual errors, and improved collaboration and productivity. Both texts also list similar tools for automating CI/CD, including Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI, Azure DevOps, and GitHub Actions. The slight differences in wording and the inclusion of an additional tool (Bamboo) in Text2 account for the minor discrepancy, but overall, the texts are highly similar in content, topic, and opinion.",
