    "The evolution of special effects in cinema has been a fascinating journey, beginning with rudimentary techniques like stop-motion and in-camera effects. During the early days of film, pioneers such as Georges Méliès employed multiple exposures and stage trickery to depict magical transformations and fantastical scenarios.
