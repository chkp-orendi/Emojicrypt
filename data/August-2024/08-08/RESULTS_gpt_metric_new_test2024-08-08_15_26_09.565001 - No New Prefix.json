Instead, use `.gitignore` to exclude them.\n5. **State Management Commands**: Use `terraform state` commands to manage and manipulate state files safely.\n6. **Environment Segregation**: Use workspaces or separate state files for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) to avoid conflicts and ensure isolation.\n\nBy following these steps and best practices, you can effectively use Terraform to manage your infrastructure as code, ensuring a streamlined and secure deployment process.",

Load balancers can distribute traffic evenly without concern for session persistence.\n\n**Resource Management:**\n- **Stateful:** Resource management is more challenging due to the need for consistent session data. Failures or scaling events can disrupt user sessions, requiring sophisticated state replication and recovery mechanisms.\n- **Stateless:** Simplifies resource management as instances are interchangeable. Instances can be added or removed without affecting user experience, leading to more efficient use of resources and easier fault tolerance.\n\nIn summary, stateless applications are generally more scalable and easier to manage in cloud environments due to their independence from session data, while stateful applications require more complex strategies to handle session persistence and resource allocation.",

They help manage cross-cutting concerns in the following ways:\n\n1. **Authentication and Authorization**: API gateways can handle user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized requests reach the microservices. This centralizes security management and reduces redundancy.\n\n2. **Logging and Monitoring**: They can log requests and responses, providing a centralized point for monitoring and analytics. This helps in tracking performance, identifying issues, and auditing access.\n\n3. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: API gateways can enforce rate limits to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources. This protects backend services from being overwhelmed by too many requests.\n\nBy centralizing these concerns, API gateways simplify the management of microservices, enhance security, and improve overall system reliability.",

If one shard/server fails, only a portion of the data is affected.\n\n**Replication:**\n- **Definition:** Replication involves copying data across multiple servers, creating redundant data sets.\n- **Performance Impact:** Enhances read performance because data can be read from multiple replicas, but can complicate write operations due to the need to synchronize data across replicas.\n- **Data Availability:** Significantly improves availability and fault tolerance, as data is duplicated across multiple servers. If one server fails, another can take over without data loss.\n\nIn summary, sharding optimizes performance by distributing data and load, while replication enhances read performance and data availability by duplicating data across servers.",

Load balancers can distribute traffic evenly without concern for session persistence.\n\n**Resource Management:**\n- **Stateful:** Resource management is more challenging due to the need for consistent session data.

If one shard/server fails, only a portion of the data is affected.\n\n**Replication:**\n- **Definition:** Replication involves copying data across multiple servers, creating redundant data sets.\n- **Performance Impact:** Enhances read performance because data can be read from multiple replicas, but can complicate write operations due to the need to synchronize data across replicas.\n- **Data Availability:** Significantly improves availability and fault tolerance, as data is duplicated across multiple servers.
