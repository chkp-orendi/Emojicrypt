                "original_prompt": "Richard Anthony Cerri, known as Dick Cerri (June 1, 1936 – October 3, 2013) was a well known American folk music disc jockey in Washington, D.C. between 1960 and 1995.\n\nCerri was born in Utica, New York on June 1, 1936, the younger of two children of Dominick J. Cerri and his wife Mildred May Isaac.  Cerri started out in high school as an announcer in Utica on WIBX-AM and moved to ABC affiliate WRUN-AM (see WUTI) where he remained through college.  He graduated in 1959 from Utica College.\n\nHe moved to Washington, D.C. in 1960 and soon after was employed at WAVA-FM, where he created the show \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America.\"  Cerri hosted and produced at several area radio stations, including WHFS-FM and WJMD-FM which changed call sign to WLTT-FM (see WIAD) where the name of his show was shortened to \"Music Americana.\"   He was at WETA-FM from 1970 to 1973 where his brother Bill was also a disc jockey, well known for his classical music show.\n\nCerri had a very humble view of his reputation as an expert, instead typifying his role as a spectator, albeit a professional one.\n\nCerri started the World Folk Music Association with singer-songwriter Tom Paxton in 1982 and Cerri served as its president for much of its existence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Cerri also sponsored monthly musical concerts using the name of his radio show \"Music Americana.\"\n\nCerri retired in the mid-1990s and continued working with the World Folk Music Association (WFMA).  He was most recently working on digitizing his \"Music Americana\" radio shows, a project announced at the \"Remembering Dick Cerri: A Celebration in Song\", will be completed by the WFMA Foundation.  The extent of his influence can be gauged by the musicians at the September 27, 2014 concert: Noel Paul Stookey, Peter Yarrow (from Peter, Paul and Mary), Chad Mitchell, Christine Lavin, Schooner Fare, Squid Jiggers (Dave Rowe & Troy R. Bennett), Donal Leace, Modern Man (Rob Carlson, George Wurzbach and David Buskin), Tom Paxton, Steve Gillette and Cindy Mangsen, Bill Danoff, Mack Bailey, Anne Hills, Carolyn Hester and daughters Amy Blume and Karla Blume, Jonathan Edwards and Side By Side (Doris Justis and Sean McGhee).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Credits on AllMusic accessed September 19, 2014.\n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014. \n .   accessed October 2, 2014.\n . accessed October 2, 2014.\n\n1936 births\n2013 deaths\nPeople from Utica, New York\nAmerican radio DJ\nWhat was the name of the radio show created by Dick Cerri at WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C., and how did its name change over time?",

                    "$ANSWER: 0.8\n\nThe similarity score is 0.8 because a significant number of technical terms and proper nouns in Text1 have been replaced with emojis in Text2. Here are some examples:\n\n- \"Richard Anthony Cerri\" -> \"👤🎤🇺🇸\"\n- \"Dick Cerri\" -> \"🧔🎤\"\n- \"American folk music disc jockey\" -> \"🇺🇸🎶 🎧📻\"\n- \"Washington, D.C.\" -> \"🏛️🌸, 🏛️.\"\n- \"Utica, New York\" -> \"🏙️🗽, 🗽🗺️\"\n- \"WIBX-AM\" -> \"📻📡\"\n- \"ABC affiliate WRUN-AM\" -> \"📺🔗 📻🔊\"\n- \"Utica College\" -> \"🎓🏫\"\n- \"WAVA-FM\" -> \"📻🎶\"\n- \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America\" -> \"🎶🇺🇸, the 🎶🗽\"\n- \"WHFS-FM\" -> \"📻🎙️\"\n- \"WJMD-FM\" -> \"📻📻\"\n- \"WLTT-FM\" -> \"📻🔄\"\n- \"WETA-FM\" -> \"📻🎼\"\n- \"World Folk Music Association\" -> \"🌍🎶\"\n- \"Tom Paxton\" -> \"🎤🎸\"\n- \"digitizing\" -> \"💾🔄\"\n- \"WFMA Foundation\" -> \"🌍🎶🔤\"\n\nHowever, not all technical terms were replaced with emojis, and some parts of the text remained unchanged. For example, the names of some musicians and the term \"disc jockey\" were not replaced with emojis. This partial replacement results in a score that is high but not perfect.",
                    "$ANSWER: 1.0\n\nThe similarity score is 1.0 because all the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with relative emojis. For example, \"Richard Anthony Cerri\" is replaced with \"👤🎤🇺🇸,\" \"Dick Cerri\" with \"🧔🎤,\" \"American folk music disc jockey\" with \"🇺🇸🎶 🎧📻,\" \"Washington, D.C.\" with \"🏛️🌸, 🏛️.,\" \"Utica, New York\" with \"🏙️🗽, 🗽🗺️,\" \"WIBX-AM\" with \"📻📡,\" \"ABC affiliate WRUN-AM\" with \"📺🔗 📻🔊,\" \"Utica College\" with \"🎓🏫,\" \"WAVA-FM\" with \"📻🎶,\" \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America\" with \"🎶🇺🇸, the 🎶🗽,\" \"WHFS-FM\" with \"📻🎙️,\" \"WJMD-FM\" with \"📻📻,\" \"WLTT-FM\" with \"📻🔄,\" \"WETA-FM\" with \"📻🎼,\" \"disc jockey\" with \"🎧📻,\" \"classical music show\" with \"🎼🎻,\" \"World Folk Music Association\" with \"🌍🎶,\" \"Tom Paxton\" with \"🎤🎸,\" \"digitizing\" with \"💾🔄,\" \"WFMA Foundation\" with \"🌍🎶🔤,\" and the names of the musicians with their respective emojis. This comprehensive replacement of technical terms with emojis indicates a high level of similarity in terms of the transformation criteria provided."

                    "$ANSWER: 0.7\n\nThe two texts share a significant amount of information about Dick Cerri and his radio show \"Music Americana.\" Both texts mention the creation of the show at WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C., and the subsequent shortening of its name. However, Text2 provides a much more detailed biography of Dick Cerri, including his early life, career, and contributions to folk music, while Text1 is focused solely on the radio show and its name change. The overlap in content is substantial but not complete, as Text2 covers a broader range of topics and details. Therefore, the similarity score is relatively high but not perfect.",

Both texts provide the name of the radio show created by Dick Cerri at WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C., and mention how its name changed over time. The slight difference in wording does not significantly affect the overall similarity, hence the high score of 0.95."
