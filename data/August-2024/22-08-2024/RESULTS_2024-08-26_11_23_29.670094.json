                    "The similarity score between the two texts is 0.7.\n\nExplanation:\n- Text2 has replaced many technical terms with emojis, such as \"footballer\" with \"⚽️💼🔴\", \"defensive midfielder\" with \"⏰👣🔜\", \"Primera División de Chile\" with \"🏃‍♂️🇨🇱🔥\", \"Torneo Clausura\" with \"🕰️🏆💪\", \"Copa Chile\" with \"🏆🎉👏\", \"loaned\" with \"📦🚫🔄\", and \"Primera B de Chile\" with \"🏃‍♂️🌟🔜\".\n- However, not all technical terms have been replaced with emojis. For example, \"Rodelindo Román\" and \"Deportes Valdivia\" remain unchanged.\n- Additionally, some parts of the text contain repeated phrases like \"Note that I've used a combination of emojis to represent each term in a way that is unique and may be difficult for humans to understand,\" which are not relevant to the original text and do not contribute to the technical term replacement.\n\nTherefore, while a significant number of technical terms have been replaced with emojis, the replacement is not complete, and some irrelevant text has been added, leading to a score of 0.7.\n\n$ANSWER: 0.7",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.9\n\nThe similarity score is 0.9 because almost all the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with relevant emojis. For example, \"professional footballer\" is replaced with \"⚽️💼🔴\", \"defensive midfielder\" with \"⏰👣🔜\", \"Segunda División\" with \"🏆🕰️🔝\", \"Primera División de Chile\" with \"🕰️🏆💪\", \"Copa Chile\" with \"🏆🎉👏\", and \"loaned\" with \"📦🚫🔄\". The structure and content of both texts are otherwise identical, with the only difference being the substitution of technical terms with emojis in Text1. This high level of correspondence in the replacement of technical terms justifies the score of 0.9."
