                    "$ANSWER: 0.8\n\nThe similarity score of 0.8 is given because the majority of the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with relative emojis, which correspond to the technical terms in Text2. Here is a breakdown of the changes:\n\n1. \"Professor\" -> 👩‍🏫📚\n2. \"Chair in Business History\" -> 🪑📜📚\n3. \"Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa\" -> 🏫📈, 🎓🇨🇦\n4. \"University of Alberta\" -> 🎓🍁\n5. \"McGill University\" -> 🎓🔴\n6. \"Qualified accountant\" -> 📊✅\n7. \"B.A., M.B.A., Ph.D.\" -> 🎓📜., M.🎓📜., 🎓🔬.\n8. \"Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario\" -> 🎓👑, Kingston, Ontario\n9. \"Seventeenth and eighteenth century international trading networks\" -> 🌍📦📜\n10. \"Trustee\" -> 🛡️📜\n11. \"President of the Academy of Accounting Historians\" -> 🏅📚📊\n12. \"Geraldine Grace and Maurice Alvin McWatters Visiting Fellowship\" -> 🏅👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🎓\n13. \"Editor of Accounting History Review\" -> 📚📊🔍\n14. \"Associate editor of the Journal of Operations Management and Accounting Perspectives\" -> 📓⚙️📈 and 📓📊🔍\n15. \"Editorial boards of Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal and Accounting Historians Journal\" -> 📝📚 of 📊📚, 📓🔍📊 and 📊📚 Historians Journal\n16. \"Shingo Research Prize for Excellence in Manufacturing Research\" -> 🏆🏭🔬\n\nHowever, not all technical terms were replaced with emojis, and some sections like \"Selected publications\" and \"References\" were left unchanged. This is why the score is not a perfect 1.0 but rather 0.8.",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.9\n\nThe similarity score is 0.9 because almost all the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with relevant emojis. For example, \"professor\" is replaced with 👩‍🏫📚, \"Father Edgar Thivierge Chair in Business History\" with 🪑📜📚, \"Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa\" with 🏫📈, 🎓🇨🇦, and so on. The emojis used are contextually appropriate and represent the technical terms effectively. However, there are a few instances where the emojis might not perfectly capture the technical term's full meaning, such as \"Shingo Research Prize for Excellence in Manufacturing Research\" being replaced with 🏆🏭🔬, which is a bit more abstract. This slight abstraction prevents the score from being a perfect 1.0."
