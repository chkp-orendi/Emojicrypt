However, not all technical terms were replaced, and some replacements may not be immediately clear, which is why the score is not a perfect 1.0.",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.9\n\nThe similarity score is 0.9 because almost all the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with relevant emojis, making it closely aligned with Text2 in terms of content. The emojis used in Text1 effectively represent the technical terms found in Text2, such as academic positions, institutions, degrees, and specific journals. However, there are a few instances where the emojis might not be immediately clear or perfectly aligned with the technical terms they replace, which prevents a perfect score of 1.0. For example, the emoji combinations for \"Father Edgar Thivierge Chair\" and \"Shingo Research Prize\" might not be as intuitive. Nonetheless, the overall effort to replace technical terms with emojis is substantial and accurate."
