Cerri and his wife Mildred May Isaac.  Cerri started out in high school as an announcer in Utica on WIBX-AM and moved to ABC affiliate WRUN-AM (see WUTI) where he remained through college.  He graduated in 1959 from Utica College.\n\nHe moved to Washington, D.C. in 1960 and soon after was employed at WAVA-FM, where he created the show \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America.\"  Cerri hosted and produced at several area radio stations, including WHFS-FM and WJMD-FM which changed call sign to WLTT-FM (see WIAD) where the name of his show was shortened to \"Music Americana.\"   He was at WETA-FM from 1970 to 1973 where his brother Bill was also a disc jockey, well known for his classical music show.\n\nCerri had a very humble view of his reputation as an expert, instead typifying his role as a spectator, albeit a professional one.\n\nCerri started the World Folk Music Association with singer-songwriter Tom Paxton in 1982 and Cerri served as its president for much of its existence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Cerri also sponsored monthly musical concerts using the name of his radio show \"Music Americana.\"\n\nCerri retired in the mid-1990s and continued working with the World Folk Music Association (WFMA).  He was most recently working on digitizing his \"Music Americana\" radio shows, a project announced at the \"Remembering Dick Cerri: A Celebration in Song\", will be completed by the WFMA Foundation.  The extent of his influence can be gauged by the musicians at the September 27, 2014 concert: Noel Paul Stookey, Peter Yarrow (from Peter, Paul and Mary), Chad Mitchell, Christine Lavin, Schooner Fare, Squid Jiggers (Dave Rowe & Troy R. Bennett), Donal Leace, Modern Man (Rob Carlson, George Wurzbach and David Buskin), Tom Paxton, Steve Gillette and Cindy Mangsen, Bill Danoff, Mack Bailey, Anne Hills, Carolyn Hester and daughters Amy Blume and Karla Blume, Jonathan Edwards and Side By Side (Doris Justis and Sean McGhee).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Credits on AllMusic accessed September 19, 2014.\n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014. \n .   accessed October 2, 2014.\n . accessed October 2, 2014.\n\n1936 births\n2013 deaths\nPeople from Utica, New York\nAmerican radio DJ\nWhat was the name of the radio show created by Dick Cerri at WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C., and how did its name change over time?",

                    "$ANSWER: 0.8\n\nThe similarity score of 0.8 is given because a significant number of technical terms and proper nouns in Text1 have been replaced with emojis in Text2. Here are some key points that justify this score:\n\n1. **Names and Titles**: \n   - \"Richard Anthony Cerri\" is replaced with \"👤🎤🇺🇸\".\n   - \"Dick Cerri\" is replaced with \"👤🎤\".\n   - \"Washington, D.C.\" is replaced with \"🏛️, 🏙️\".\n   - \"Utica, New York\" is replaced with \"🏘️, 🗽\".\n   - \"WIBX-AM\" is replaced with \"📻📶\".\n   - \"ABC affiliate WRUN-AM\" is replaced with \"📺📻\".\n   - \"Utica College\" is replaced with \"🎓🏫\".\n   - \"WAVA-FM\" is replaced with \"📻🎶\".\n   - \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America\" is replaced with \"🎶🇺🇸, 🎶🗽\".\n   - \"WHFS-FM\" is replaced with \"📻🎧\".\n   - \"WJMD-FM\" is replaced with \"📻🎙️\".\n   - \"WLTT-FM\" is replaced with \"📻🔄\".\n   - \"WETA-FM\" is replaced with \"📻🎼\".\n   - \"World Folk Music Association\" is replaced with \"🌍🎶👥\".\n   - \"Tom Paxton\" is replaced with \"🎸🎤\".\n   - \"Noel Paul Stookey\" is replaced with \"🎤🎸\".\n   - \"Peter Yarrow\" is replaced with \"🎤 Yarrow\".\n   - \"Squid Jiggers\" is replaced with \"🦑🎤\".\n   - \"Modern Man\" is replaced with \"🎤👨\".\n   - \"Tom Paxton\" is replaced with \"🎸🎤\".\n\n2. **Consistency**: The emojis are consistently used to replace the same terms throughout the text, maintaining the context and meaning.\n\n3. **Technical Terms**: Most of the technical terms related to radio stations, music shows, and associations have been replaced with relevant emojis.\n\nHowever, not all technical terms and proper nouns were replaced with emojis. For example, \"Dominick J. Cerri and his wife Mildred May Isaac\" and \"Bill\" were not replaced with emojis. Additionally, some specific terms like \"digitizing\" and \"concert\" were not replaced with emojis.\n\nOverall, the replacement of technical terms and proper nouns with emojis is extensive but not complete, leading to a high but not perfect similarity score.",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.9\n\nThe similarity score is 0.9 because almost all the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with relative emojis. Here is a breakdown of the changes:\n\n1. Names: \"Richard Anthony Cerri\" to \"👤🎤🇺🇸\" and \"Dick Cerri\" to \"👤🎤\".\n2. Dates: \"June 1, 1936 – October 3, 2013\" remains unchanged.\n3. Nationality and profession: \"American folk music disc jockey\" to \"🇺🇸🎶📻\".\n4. Locations: \"Washington, D.C.\" to \"🏛️, 🏙️\", \"Utica, New York\" to \"🏘️, 🗽\".\n5. Radio stations: \"WIBX-AM\" to \"📻📶\", \"WRUN-AM\" to \"📺📻\", \"WAVA-FM\" to \"📻🎶\", \"WHFS-FM\" to \"📻🎧\", \"WJMD-FM\" to \"📻🎙️\", \"WLTT-FM\" to \"📻🔄\", \"WETA-FM\" to \"📻🎼\".\n6. Show names: \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America\" to \"🎶🇺🇸, 🎶🗽\", \"Music Americana\" to \"🎶🇺🇸\".\n7. Associations: \"World Folk Music Association\" to \"🌍🎶👥\".\n8. Individuals: \"Tom Paxton\" to \"🎸🎤\", \"Noel Paul Stookey\" to \"🎤🎸\", \"Peter Yarrow\" to \"🎤 Yarrow\", \"Peter, Paul and Mary\" to \"🎤, Paul and Mary\", \"Squid Jiggers\" to \"🦑🎤\", \"Modern Man\" to \"🎤👨\", \"Tom Paxton\" to \"🎸🎤\".\n\nThe only reason the score is not a perfect 1.0 is that some dates and a few other minor details were not converted to emojis, but the majority of technical terms were effectively replaced with relevant emojis."

                    "$ANSWER: 0.4\n\nThe two texts share some common information, specifically about Dick Cerri and the radio show he created at WAVA-FM, which was initially called \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America\" and later shortened to \"Music Americana.\" However, the first text is very brief and focuses solely on the name and evolution of the radio show. In contrast, the second text is much more detailed, providing extensive background information on Dick Cerri's life, career, and contributions to folk music, as well as additional context about his work at various radio stations and his involvement with the World Folk Music Association.\n\nWhile there is overlap in the specific detail about the radio show's name, the overall content, scope, and focus of the two texts are quite different. Therefore, the similarity score is moderate but not high.",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.95\n\nThe two texts are highly similar, discussing the same topic, sharing the same opinion, and covering the same key details. Both texts provide the name of the radio show created by Dick Cerri at WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C., and mention how its name was shortened over time. The slight difference in wording does not significantly affect the overall similarity, hence the high score of 0.95."
