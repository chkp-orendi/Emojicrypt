                    "$ANSWER: 0.6\n\nThe similarity score is 0.6 because while many technical terms have been replaced with emojis, not all relevant terms have been changed. For example, \"defensive midfielder\" was replaced with \"⏰👣🔜,\" \"Primera División de Chile\" with \"🏃‍♂️🇨🇱🔥,\" and \"Copa Chile\" with \"🏆🎉👏.\" However, there are still several technical terms that were not replaced with emojis, such as \"Segunda División,\" \"loaned,\" and \"appearances.\" Additionally, some parts of the text were left unchanged, and the use of emojis was inconsistent, leading to a partial but not complete transformation.",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.8\n\nThe similarity score is 0.8 because the majority of the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with emojis that correspond to their meanings in Text2. For example:\n- \"professional footballer\" is replaced with \"⚽️💼🔴\"\n- \"defensive midfielder\" is replaced with \"⏰👣🔜\"\n- \"Segunda División\" is replaced with \"🏆🕰️🔝\"\n- \"Primera División de Chile\" is replaced with \"🕰️🏆💪\"\n- \"Copa Chile\" is replaced with \"🏆🎉👏\"\n- \"loaned\" is replaced with \"📦🚫🔄\"\n- \"goal\" is replaced with \"⚽️🏁🔥\"\n- \"Primera B de Chile\" is replaced with \"🏃‍♂️🌟🔜\"\n\nHowever, not all technical terms have been replaced with emojis, and some phrases are repeated multiple times, which slightly reduces the score from a perfect 1.0."
