                    "The similarity score between the two texts is 0.7.\n\nExplanation:\n- Text2 has replaced many technical terms with emojis, such as \"professional footballer\" with \"⚽️💼🔴\", \"defensive midfielder\" with \"⏰👣🔜\", \"Segunda División\" with \"🏆🕰️🔝\", \"Primera División de Chile\" with \"🏃‍♂️🇨🇱🔥\", \"Torneo Clausura\" with \"🕰️🏆💪\", \"Copa Chile\" with \"🏆🎉👏\", and \"loaned\" with \"📦🚫🔄\".\n- However, not all technical terms were replaced with emojis. For example, \"Rodelindo Román\", \"Colo-Colo\", \"San Marcos de Arica\", \"Deportes Valdivia\", \"Huachipato\", \"Unión San Felipe\", and \"San Antonio Unido\" were not replaced with emojis.\n- Additionally, some parts of the text were left unchanged, such as \"In 2020, he joined Rodelindo Román.\" and \"References\".\n\nTherefore, while a significant number of technical terms were replaced with emojis, not all were, leading to a score of 0.7.\n\n$ANSWER: 0.7",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.8\n\nThe similarity score is 0.8 because the majority of the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with emojis that correspond to their meanings in Text2. For example:\n- \"professional footballer\" is replaced with \"⚽️💼🔴\"\n- \"defensive midfielder\" is replaced with \"⏰👣🔜\"\n- \"Segunda División\" is replaced with \"🏆🕰️🔝\"\n- \"Primera División de Chile\" is replaced with \"🕰️🏆💪\"\n- \"Copa Chile\" is replaced with \"🏆🎉👏\"\n- \"loaned\" is replaced with \"📦🚫🔄\"\n- \"goal\" is replaced with \"⚽️🏁🔥\"\n- \"Primera B de Chile\" is replaced with \"🏃‍♂️🌟🔜\"\n\nHowever, not all technical terms have been replaced with emojis, and some phrases are repeated multiple times in Text1, which slightly reduces the score."
