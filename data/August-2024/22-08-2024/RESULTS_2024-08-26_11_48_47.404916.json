Cerri and his wife Mildred May Isaac.  Cerri started out in high school as an announcer in Utica on WIBX-AM and moved to ABC affiliate WRUN-AM (see WUTI) where he remained through college.  He graduated in 1959 from Utica College.\n\nHe moved to Washington, D.C. in 1960 and soon after was employed at WAVA-FM, where he created the show \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America.\"  Cerri hosted and produced at several area radio stations, including WHFS-FM and WJMD-FM which changed call sign to WLTT-FM (see WIAD) where the name of his show was shortened to \"Music Americana.\"   He was at WETA-FM from 1970 to 1973 where his brother Bill was also a disc jockey, well known for his classical music show.\n\nCerri had a very humble view of his reputation as an expert, instead typifying his role as a spectator, albeit a professional one.\n\nCerri started the World Folk Music Association with singer-songwriter Tom Paxton in 1982 and Cerri served as its president for much of its existence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Cerri also sponsored monthly musical concerts using the name of his radio show \"Music Americana.\"\n\nCerri retired in the mid-1990s and continued working with the World Folk Music Association (WFMA).  He was most recently working on digitizing his \"Music Americana\" radio shows, a project announced at the \"Remembering Dick Cerri: A Celebration in Song\", will be completed by the WFMA Foundation.

                    "$ANSWER: 0.3\n\nThe similarity score is 0.3 because only a few technical terms were replaced with emojis in Text2. Specifically, \"folk music disc jockey\" was replaced with 🎶🎵🔊 🎤💃🕺, and \"Washington, D.C.\" was replaced with 🏛️🗼️🌆, ⚫️🔴📜. Additionally, \"disc jockey\" was replaced with 🎤💃🕺. However, many other technical terms and proper nouns, such as the names of radio stations (WIBX-AM, WRUN-AM, WAVA-FM, etc.), the name of the show (\"Music Americana\"), and the names of people and organizations, were not replaced with emojis. Therefore, the score reflects that while some effort was made to replace technical terms with emojis, it was not comprehensive.",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.8\n\nThe similarity score is 0.8 because the majority of the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with relevant emojis. For example, \"folk music disc jockey\" is replaced with 🎶🎵🔊 🎤💃🕺, and \"Washington, D.C.\" is replaced with 🏛️🗼️🌆, ⚫️🔴📜. However, not all technical terms have been replaced with emojis, and some terms like \"Utica College\" and \"World Folk Music Association\" remain unchanged. This partial replacement results in a high but not perfect similarity score."
