                "original_prompt": "Richard Anthony Cerri, known as Dick Cerri (June 1, 1936 – October 3, 2013) was a well known American folk music disc jockey in Washington, D.C. between 1960 and 1995.\n\nCerri was born in Utica, New York on June 1, 1936, the younger of two children of Dominick J. Cerri and his wife Mildred May Isaac.  Cerri started out in high school as an announcer in Utica on WIBX-AM and moved to ABC affiliate WRUN-AM (see WUTI) where he remained through college.  He graduated in 1959 from Utica College.\n\nHe moved to Washington, D.C. in 1960 and soon after was employed at WAVA-FM, where he created the show \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America.\"  Cerri hosted and produced at several area radio stations, including WHFS-FM and WJMD-FM which changed call sign to WLTT-FM (see WIAD) where the name of his show was shortened to \"Music Americana.\"   He was at WETA-FM from 1970 to 1973 where his brother Bill was also a disc jockey, well known for his classical music show.\n\nCerri had a very humble view of his reputation as an expert, instead typifying his role as a spectator, albeit a professional one.\n\nCerri started the World Folk Music Association with singer-songwriter Tom Paxton in 1982 and Cerri served as its president for much of its existence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Cerri also sponsored monthly musical concerts using the name of his radio show \"Music Americana.\"\n\nCerri retired in the mid-1990s and continued working with the World Folk Music Association (WFMA).  He was most recently working on digitizing his \"Music Americana\" radio shows, a project announced at the \"Remembering Dick Cerri: A Celebration in Song\", will be completed by the WFMA Foundation.  The extent of his influence can be gauged by the musicians at the September 27, 2014 concert: Noel Paul Stookey, Peter Yarrow (from Peter, Paul and Mary), Chad Mitchell, Christine Lavin, Schooner Fare, Squid Jiggers (Dave Rowe & Troy R. Bennett), Donal Leace, Modern Man (Rob Carlson, George Wurzbach and David Buskin), Tom Paxton, Steve Gillette and Cindy Mangsen, Bill Danoff, Mack Bailey, Anne Hills, Carolyn Hester and daughters Amy Blume and Karla Blume, Jonathan Edwards and Side By Side (Doris Justis and Sean McGhee).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Credits on AllMusic accessed September 19, 2014.\n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014.  \n .  accessed September 19, 2014. \n .   accessed October 2, 2014.\n . accessed October 2, 2014.\n\n1936 births\n2013 deaths\nPeople from Utica, New York\nAmerican radio DJ\nWhat was the name of the radio show created by Dick Cerri at WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C., and how did its name change over time?",

                    "$ANSWER: 0.8\n\nThe similarity score is 0.8 because a significant number of technical terms and proper nouns in Text1 have been replaced with emojis in Text2. For example:\n\n- \"Richard Anthony Cerri\" is replaced with \"👤🎤🇺🇸\"\n- \"Dick Cerri\" is replaced with \"🧔🎤\"\n- \"Washington, D.C.\" is replaced with \"🏛️🌸, 🏛️.\"\n- \"Utica, New York\" is replaced with \"🏙️🗽, 🗽🗺️\"\n- \"WIBX-AM\" is replaced with \"📻📡\"\n- \"ABC affiliate WRUN-AM\" is replaced with \"📺📡\"\n- \"Utica College\" is replaced with \"🎓🏙️\"\n- \"WAVA-FM\" is replaced with \"📻🎶\"\n- \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America\" is replaced with \"🎶🇺🇸, 🎶🗽🇺🇸\"\n- \"WHFS-FM\" is replaced with \"📻🎧\"\n- \"WJMD-FM\" is replaced with \"📻🎙️\"\n- \"WLTT-FM\" is replaced with \"📻🔄\"\n- \"WETA-FM\" is replaced with \"📻🎼\"\n- \"World Folk Music Association\" is replaced with \"🌍🎶👥\"\n- \"Tom Paxton\" is replaced with \"🎤🎸\"\n- \"Noel Paul Stookey\" is replaced with \"🎤🎶\"\n- \"Peter Yarrow\" is replaced with \"🎤🎸\"\n- \"Chad Mitchell\" is replaced with \"🎤🎶\"\n- \"Christine Lavin\" is replaced with \"🎤🎸\"\n- \"Schooner Fare\" is replaced with \"🎤🎶⛵\"\n- \"Squid Jiggers\" is replaced with \"🦑🎤\"\n- \"Donal Leace\" is replaced with \"🎤🎶\"\n- \"Modern Man\" is replaced with \"👨🎤\"\n- \"Steve Gillette and Cindy Mangsen\" is replaced with \"🎤🎶 and 🎤🎸\"\n- \"Bill Danoff\" is replaced with \"🎤🎶\"\n- \"Mack Bailey\" is replaced with \"🎤🎸\"\n\nHowever, not all technical terms and proper nouns were replaced with emojis, and some parts of the text remain unchanged. This is why the score is not a perfect 1.0.",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.9\n\nThe similarity score is 0.9 because almost all the technical terms in Text1 have been replaced with relative emojis, making it highly similar to Text2 in terms of content. The key technical terms such as names, locations, and specific radio stations have been substituted with emojis in Text1, which aligns with the requirement. However, there are a few instances where the emojis might not perfectly capture the technical term's specificity, such as the use of general music-related emojis instead of specific ones for different types of music or radio stations. This slight deviation prevents a perfect score of 1.0."

                    "$ANSWER: 0.7\n\nThe two texts share a significant amount of information about Dick Cerri and his radio show, \"Music Americana.\" Both texts mention the original and shortened names of the show and its creation at WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C. However, Text2 provides a much more detailed biography of Dick Cerri, including his early life, career, and contributions to folk music, while Text1 is very brief and focused solely on the radio show's name and its change over time. The overlap in content is substantial but not complete, as Text2 covers a broader range of topics and details. Therefore, the similarity score is relatively high but not perfect.",
                    "$ANSWER: 0.95\n\nThe two texts are highly similar, discussing the same topic, sharing the same opinion, and covering the same key details. Both texts provide the name of the radio show created by Dick Cerri at WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C., and mention how its name was shortened over time. The slight difference in wording and additional context in Text1 does not significantly affect the core information being conveyed. Therefore, a similarity score of 0.95 is appropriate."
