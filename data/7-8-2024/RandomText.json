Instead, use `.gitignore` to exclude them.\n5. **State Management Commands**: Use `terraform state` commands to manage and manipulate state files safely.\n6. **Environment Segregation**: Use workspaces or separate state files for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) to avoid conflicts and ensure isolation.\n\nBy following these steps and best practices, you can effectively use Terraform to manage your infrastructure as code, ensuring a streamlined and secure deployment process.",

Load balancers can distribute traffic evenly without concern for session persistence.\n\n**Resource Management:**\n- **Stateful:** Resource management is more challenging due to the need for consistent session data. Failures or scaling events can disrupt user sessions, requiring sophisticated state replication and recovery mechanisms.\n- **Stateless:** Simplifies resource management as instances are interchangeable.
