                "original_answer": "Raven Davis's work centers around key themes such as culture, colonization, sexuality, gender, and racial justice. These themes are deeply influenced by their personal background and identity as an Indigenous person of the Anishinaabe (Ojibway) Nation, as well as their experiences as a two-spirited individual.\n\n1. **Culture and Colonization**: Davis's work often explores the impact of colonization on Indigenous cultures and communities. Their heritage and upbringing in the Anishinaabe Nation provide a rich cultural context that informs their artistic expression and activism. By addressing the historical and ongoing effects of colonization, Davis seeks to highlight the resilience and strength of Indigenous peoples.\n\n2. **Sexuality and Gender**: As a two-spirited person, Davis's work frequently addresses issues related to gender and sexuality. The concept of being two-spirited is unique to Indigenous cultures and encompasses a blend of masculine and feminine qualities. This identity allows Davis to challenge and expand conventional understandings of gender and sexuality, advocating for greater acceptance and recognition of diverse identities.\n\n3. **Racial Justice**: Davis's activism and art also focus on racial justice, particularly the experiences and struggles of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Their work aims to raise awareness about systemic racism and the need for social change, often through powerful visual and performance art that engages and educates audiences.\n\nDavis's personal experiences, including being raised by an Anishinaabe artist mother and their own journey through educational institutions like Ryerson University and George Brown College, have shaped their perspective and approach to art and activism. Their role as a parent of three sons further grounds their work in the realities of family and community life.\n\nOverall, Raven Davis's multifaceted identity and personal history deeply influence their artistic and activist endeavors, driving their commitment to social justice and cultural preservation.",

                    "$ANSWER: 0.8\n\nThe similarity score of 0.8 is given because a significant number of technical terms and proper nouns in Text1 have been replaced with relative emojis in Text2.

This partial replacement results in a score less than 1.0.",

There were many Portuguese associations in the city, representing immigrants from specific regions of Portugal, and the original idea of the founders was to bring these organizations under one roof. The foundation of the Casa de Portugal saw representatives of União Transmontana, Casa do Minho, União Portuguesa, Centro Beirão and Centro do Douro. Other organizations were subsequently invited, but preferred to maintain their regional character and refused. The first president was the philologist Francisco da Luz Rebelo Gonçalves, a professor at the newly founded University of São Paulo, but he remained in office for only 10 months and was succeeded for the interim by Aurélio Martins Arrobas and in 1936 by Fernando Ribeiro Bacellar.\n\nInitially the Casa de Portugal worked at the headquarters of the Casa do Minho and then in rented properties. Through donations from members and bank loans land and buildings were purchased on the Avenida da Liberdade, in the city center in 1943. The inauguration of the headquarters took place on December 27, 1955.\n\nFeatures \nThe headquarters of the Casa de Portugal is a neocolonial building of five floors designed by Portuguese architect Ricardo Severo. The lobby is decorated with paintings depicting Afonso I, the first king of Portugal, and Manuel da Nobrega, a Portuguese Jesuit priest very influential in the early History of Brazil, and who participated in the founding of several cities, such as Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, and many Jesuit Colleges and seminaries. The building also has meeting rooms, a restaurant, theater, gallery exhibition and a ballroom with a capacity for 1,000 people.\n\nThe Casa de Portugal also serves as headquarters for the Council of the Luso-Brazilian Community of São Paulo, the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and the Ombudsman of the Portuguese Community. It was also headquarters for the Consulate of Portugal in São Paulo and the Camões Institute, but these institutions have moved to a building in the Jardim América area in 2004.\n\nLibrary \nThe creation of a library for the Casa de Portugal had been planned since its foundation, when the partners began to donate books to the collection. In 1957 the library was opened, and in 1991 it was extended with an auditorium and reading room. Currently it has 12,000 volumes, of which almost half are dedicated to history and Luso-Brazilian literature.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n Facebook page of Casa de Portugal\n\nPortuguese emigrants to Brazil\nPortuguese diaspora\nOrganisations based in São Paulo\n1935 establishments in Bra\nWhat was the original aim of the founders when they established the Casa de Portugal in São Paulo in 1935?",

The foundation of the 🏠🇵🇹 saw representatives of 🏢🇵🇹1, 🏢🇵🇹2, 🏢🇵🇹3, 🏢🇵🇹4 and 🏢🇵🇹5. Other organizations were subsequently invited, but preferred to maintain their regional character and refused. The first president was the philologist 👨‍🏫🇵🇹, a professor at the newly founded University of 🌆🇧🇷, but he remained in office for only 10 months and was succeeded for the interim by 👨‍💼🇵🇹1 and in 1936 by 👨‍💼🇵🇹2.\n\nInitially the 🏠🇵🇹 worked at the headquarters of the 🏢🇵🇹2 and then in rented properties. Through donations from members and bank loans land and buildings were purchased on the 🛣️🌆🇧🇷, in the city center in 1943. The inauguration of the headquarters took place on December 27, 1955.\n\nFeatures \nThe headquarters of the 🏠🇵🇹 is a 🏛️🏗️ of five floors designed by Portuguese architect 👷‍♂️🇵🇹. The lobby is decorated with paintings depicting 👑🇵🇹, the first king of Portugal, and ⛪🇵🇹, a Portuguese Jesuit priest very influential in the early 📜🇧🇷, and who participated in the founding of several cities, such as 🌆🇧🇷1, 🌆🇧🇷2, 🌆🇧🇷3 and 🌆🇧🇷, and many 🎓⛪ and seminaries. The building also has meeting rooms, a restaurant, theater, gallery exhibition and a ballroom with a capacity for 1,000 people.\n\nThe 🏠🇵🇹 also serves as headquarters for the Council of the Luso-Brazilian Community of 🌆🇧🇷, the 🏢💼🇵🇹 and the 🏢🛡️🇵🇹. It was also headquarters for the 🏢🇵🇹 in 🌆🇧🇷 and the 🏢📚🇵🇹, but these institutions have moved to a building in the Jardim América area in 2004.\n\nLibrary \nThe creation of a library for the 🏠🇵🇹 had been planned since its foundation, when the partners began to donate books to the collection. In 1957 the library was opened, and in 1991 it was extended with an auditorium and reading room. Currently it has 12,000 volumes, of which almost half are dedicated to history and Luso-Brazilian literature.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n Facebook page of 🏠🇵🇹\n\nPortuguese emigrants to Brazil\nPortuguese diaspora\nOrganisations based in 🌆🇧🇷\n1935 establishments in Bra\nWhat was the original aim of the founders when they established the 🏠🇵🇹 in 🌆🇧🇷 in 1935?",

In 2012 it was named one of the world's top fast food chains by Travel & Leisure magazine.\n\nEl Meson Sandwiches is family-owned and operated. It has 37 locations in Puerto Rico and three in Florida, at the Florida Mall, in Kissimmee and Lee Vista Promenade.\n\nEl Meson began franchising in 2018. El Meson Sandwiches units average $2 million in sales per year. System-wide sales in 2015 were just under $80 million.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first El Meson Sandwiches opened in 1972 in the beach town of Aguadilla on Puerto Rico's northwestern tip. The restaurant was started by Felipe Perez Sr., father of the current CEO, Felipe Pérez Grajales. The original restaurant was known primarily for two things: home-style sandwiches and a familial atmosphere.\n\nMany of El Meson's early customers were American surfers who came early in the day asking for big, healthy breakfasts. Their requests prompted Perez Sr. to create a sandwich dubbed The Surfer, which comes stuffed with fresh vegetables and soy-based protein. The second Puerto Rico location opened in 1987, shortly after the younger Perez returned from college in Jacksonville, Florida. Rapid growth followed.\n\nProducts\n\nEl Meson sandwiches are mostly served on criollo bread, a sweet, French-style bread with a Caribbean flavor. Most are pressed on a hot grill and served with cabbage, tomatoes, and mayo. The Delicioso sandwich comes with turkey and bacon. The White House is grilled with roast beef, turkey and mushrooms. El Meson also serves sandwiches on baked potatoes.\n\nCurrent leadership\n\nFelipe Pérez Grajales is the current CEO of El Meson Sandwiches. He was born in 1965, the eldest of three brothers. From the early 1970s through his high school years, Grajales worked in the original El Meson restaurant in Aguadilla. In 1983 he left Puerto Rico to attend Jacksonville University. Though he received several offers from companies in the U.S., he returned to Puerto Rico in 1986 to help expand the family business.\n\nGrajales has been recognized as an outstanding businessman by Ernst & Young, the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce, the Sales & Marketing Executives (SME) Association, and the House of Representatives and Senate of Puerto Rico.\n\nHe was president of the Organizing Committee for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayagüez in 2010 and is president of the Mayagüez 2010 Foundation.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Meson Sandwiches Official Website\n Puerto Rican El Meson Sandwiches Website (In Spanish)\n\n1972 establishments in Puerto Rico\nRestaurants in Puerto Rico\nMayagüez, Puerto Rico\nPrivately held companies of Puerto Rico\nPuerto Rican brands\nRestaurants established in 1972\nWhat prompted Felipe Perez Sr. to create the sandwich known as \"The Surfer\" at the original El Meson Sandwiches location in Aguadilla?",

It is the 87th film in ESPN's 30 for 30 series. The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nBackground \nIn 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58–7. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.\n\nThe rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.\n\nThe documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.\n\nCast \nCreadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall. The film also features interviews with head coaches Lou Holtz and Jimmy Johnson; Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez; Notre Dame players Chris Zorich, Pat Eilers, Pat Terrell, and Todd Lyght, among others; and Miami players Steve Walsh, Cleveland Gary, and Leon Searcy, among others.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson called Catholics vs. Convicts a \"gripping gridiron drama.\" Sporting News ranks the film \"among the best\" of the 30 for 30 franchise.\n\nReferences \n\nNotre Dame vs. Miami\nMiami Hurricanes football\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish football\n30 for 30\n2016 telev\nWhat controversial event from the 1988 Notre Dame-Miami football game is closely examined in the 2016 documentary \"Catholics vs. Convicts,\" and how did the filmmakers' re-examination of this event impact the perspectives of the coaches and players involved?",

Many of them had never seen the replay of these controversial moments, and the documentary's detailed analysis led several subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. This re-evaluation added depth to the narrative and highlighted the lasting impact of these critical decisions on the memories and opinions of those who participated in the game.",

Cerri and his wife Mildred May Isaac.  Cerri started out in high school as an announcer in Utica on WIBX-AM and moved to ABC affiliate WRUN-AM (see WUTI) where he remained through college.  He graduated in 1959 from Utica College.\n\nHe moved to Washington, D.C. in 1960 and soon after was employed at WAVA-FM, where he created the show \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America.\"  Cerri hosted and produced at several area radio stations, including WHFS-FM and WJMD-FM which changed call sign to WLTT-FM (see WIAD) where the name of his show was shortened to \"Music Americana.\"   He was at WETA-FM from 1970 to 1973 where his brother Bill was also a disc jockey, well known for his classical music show.\n\nCerri had a very humble view of his reputation as an expert, instead typifying his role as a spectator, albeit a professional one.\n\nCerri started the World Folk Music Association with singer-songwriter Tom Paxton in 1982 and Cerri served as its president for much of its existence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Cerri also sponsored monthly musical concerts using the name of his radio show \"Music Americana.\"\n\nCerri retired in the mid-1990s and continued working with the World Folk Music Association (WFMA).  He was most recently working on digitizing his \"Music Americana\" radio shows, a project announced at the \"Remembering Dick Cerri: A Celebration in Song\", will be completed by the WFMA Foundation.  The extent of his influence can be gauged by the musicians at the September 27, 2014 concert: Noel Paul Stookey, Peter Yarrow (from Peter, Paul and Mary), Chad Mitchell, Christine Lavin, Schooner Fare, Squid Jiggers (Dave Rowe & Troy R.

                    "$ANSWER: 0.7\n\nThe similarity score of 0.7 is given because a significant number of technical terms and proper nouns in Text1 have been replaced with emojis in Text2. Here are some key points that justify this score:\n\n1. **Names and Titles**: \"Richard Anthony Cerri\" is replaced with \"👤🎤🇺🇸\" and \"Dick Cerri\" with \"👤🎤\". The radio show \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America\" is replaced with \"🎶🇺🇸, 🎶🇺🇸\".\n\n2. **Locations**: \"Washington, D.C.\" is replaced with \"🏛️, 🏙️\", and \"Utica, New York\" with \"🏘️, 🗽\".\n\n3. **Radio Stations**: Specific radio station call signs like \"WAVA-FM\", \"WHFS-FM\", and \"WJMD-FM\" are replaced with \"📻🎶\".\n\n4. **Organizations**: \"World Folk Music Association\" is replaced with \"🌍🎶👥\".\n\n5. **Musicians**: Names of musicians like \"Tom Paxton\" and \"Peter Yarrow\" are replaced with \"🎤🎸\".\n\nHowever, not all technical terms and proper nouns were replaced with emojis. For example, \"Utica College\" and \"WIBX-AM\" were not replaced. Additionally, some terms like \"disc jockey\" and \"classical music show\" were not converted to emojis. This partial replacement results in a score that is not perfect but still high, reflecting a substantial but incomplete transformation.",

The names of people, places, and specific terms related to the radio industry have been effectively substituted with emojis. However, there are a few instances where the technical terms were not replaced with emojis, such as \"WUTI\" and \"WIAD,\" which slightly reduces the score from a perfect 1.0."

                "original_answer": "The 1984 Iranian parliamentary elections were conducted under several unique and challenging conditions that significantly affected the election process. These conditions included:\n\n1. **War with Iraq (Iran-Iraq War)**: The ongoing conflict with Iraq's Baathist government created a highly unstable and dangerous environment, particularly in border regions. Many cities near the border with Iraq were severely damaged or could not hold direct elections due to the war. This necessitated the use of both direct and indirect election methods.\n\n2. **Severe Sanctions**: Iran was under severe political and economic sanctions, which added to the overall strain on the country's resources and infrastructure. These sanctions likely impacted the logistics and administration of the elections.\n\n3. **Political Restrictions**: This election was the first since the 1979 revolution in which only one political party, the Islamic Republican Party, was allowed to participate. Other political parties were banned or dissolved before the election. This restriction on political pluralism meant that the majority of seats were won by independents, with the Islamic Republican Party being the only party to secure seats.\n\n4. **Boycott by the Freedom Movement of Iran**: The Freedom Movement of Iran declared a boycott of the elections after its headquarters was attacked and the authorities refused to permit the party to hold two seminars. This boycott further limited the political diversity and competition in the elections.\n\n5. **Election Methods**: Due to the war, the election process had to be adapted. In areas not heavily affected by the war and for religious minority seats, direct national elections were held. However, in areas heavily affected by the war, mainly in border regions with Iraq, indirect national elections were conducted. Out of 193 constituencies, 187 held direct elections, while six constituencies held indirect elections.\n\n6. **Voter Turnout**: Despite these challenging conditions, voter turnout was relatively high at 65.1% in the first round, indicating a significant level of public participation despite the adversities.\n\nThe unique conditions of war, sanctions, political restrictions, and the need for both direct and indirect election methods created a complex and challenging environment for the 1984 Iranian parliamentary elections. These factors influenced not only the logistics and administration of the elections but also the political landscape and the nature of electoral competition.",

There are 2 vacant anchor store that were once Carson's and Sears. It is managed by T Danville, a division of Tabani Group.\n\nHistory\nVillage Mall was developed in the 1970s by SES Development Company. The first store to open was an Ayr-Way discount store in 1972, which later became Target. It was followed by  a National Supermarkets and a Meis department store, which was later sold to Elder-Beerman. The mall itself opened in 1975. J. C. Penney was added in 1985. Sears, which previously had a store in downtown Danville, was offered an incentive by the city to move to the mall in the early 1990s.\n\nTarget closed in 1997 due to low sales, and by 1999 had become a Hobby Lobby. J. C. Penney closed its Danville store in 2001 along with two others in Illinois. In 2004, a wing of the mall was renovated to make room for a Goody's clothing store. The former J. C. Penney store became Steve & Barry's in 2006. That same year, several anchors were proposed for the mall, including Old Navy and Dunham's Sports. County Market, which replaced National Supermarket, was also expanded.\n\nHobby Lobby, Steve & Barry's, and Goody's all closed in 2008, the latter two due to bankruptcy of the chains. The loss of these stores led to rumors that the mall would close or be converted to other uses, or that Elder-Beerman or Sears would relocate to elsewhere in town.\n\nDespite these closures, Pet Supplies Plus opened in part of the former Hobby Lobby. By 2010, the last restaurant had closed in the food court. Elder-Beerman was re-branded Carson's in 2011, and Dunham's Sports filled the rest of the former Hobby Lobby. The former Goody's space became Ross Dress for Less in mid-2012. In mid-2013, Burlington Coat Factory opened in the former J. C. Penney/Steve & Barry's space. The addition of new stores brought occupancy levels up to 78 percent. In September 2014, Sears announced that it would close the Village Mall store. In mid-2015, a Jo-Ann Fabrics was added to the mall, while the city of Danville offered an incentive to the Slumberland Furniture chain to open a store in part of the former Sears.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, The Bon-Ton Stores announced that Carson's would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2018.

They also cover the closure of Sears and the addition of new stores like Pet Supplies Plus, Ross Dress for Less, Jo-Ann Fabrics, and Slumberland Furniture.\n\nThe slight differences in the texts, such as the specific years of certain events and additional context provided in Text2, account for the score not being a perfect 1.0.

They also cover additional changes to other stores in the mall, such as the addition and closure of J. C.

For example, Text1 provides a more comprehensive timeline and additional context about the mall's management and other stores, while Text2 is more concise and contains a slight error (Meis was re-branded as Carson's, not Meis again). These differences prevent the score from being a perfect 1.0 but still reflect a high degree of similarity."

While the station has a waiting room, it is only open in early mornings and late evenings, half an hour before the first westbound and eastbound train arrives. It does not have a ticket agent, but the station does have personnel that can assist riders upon departure and arrival. The station is directly across the tracks from the National New York Central Railroad Museum.\n\nHistory \nElkhart station was originally built in 1900 by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and had a freight house installed across the tracks in 1907. The building is constructed of red brick trimmed with limestone, which is used for the window surrounds and belt course. The station was originally set amid a well-kept garden that displayed neat beds of colorful flowers and a row of trees along the tracks; this manicured landscape was not only a pretty introduction to the city for first time visitors, but it also buffered the streets of downtown from the noise and dirt associated with steam engines and freight trains. The station and the railroad were acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1914. NYC merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, and passenger service was taken over by Amtrak in 1971. The freight house became the National NYC Museum in 1987.\n\nTransit connections \n\nMACOG Interurban Trolley's Elkhart-Goshen and Concord routes both stop near the station.

However, not all technical terms have been replaced with emojis. For instance, terms like \"Government\", \"programs and services\", \"headquartered\", \"volunteers\", \"auxiliary\", \"alumnae\", \"foundations\", and \"auxiliaries\" remain unchanged. Additionally, some specific names of hospitals and other entities are not replaced with emojis.

It combines influences of Type O Negative, The Sisters of Mercy, Peter Gabriel, dark wave and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of electronic music, jazz fusion, post-punk, gothic rock and new wave.  It was produced by Toby Driver.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on The Flenser for one of Driver's other bands, Vaura, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010.

Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically Blade Runner.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through The Flenser. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in MP3, FLAC, CD and LP. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction.

The combination of these words reflects the intense emotional battle and the strength required to confront and overcome such deep personal challenges.",
                "original_answer": "The title \"Nero Forte,\" which translates from Italian to \"black strong\" or \"black force,\" holds significant relevance to the song's themes and lyrics. Although the title itself does not appear in the lyrics, it metaphorically encapsulates the essence of the song's subject matter. \n\nThe term \"Nero\" (black) symbolizes the darkness and depression that Corey Taylor, the band's lead vocalist, describes sinking into. This darkness is portrayed as an overwhelming and consuming force, akin to an entity that Taylor felt powerless against. The use of \"black\" effectively conveys the depth and intensity of the emotional struggle and the bleakness of the mental state he experienced.\n\n\"Forte\" (strong) can be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, it signifies the strength and intensity of the depression, emphasizing how powerful and dominating this dark force was in Taylor's life. Secondly, \"forte\" can also mean something in which one excels, which might suggest a duality where the struggle with darkness is a significant and defining part of Taylor's personal and artistic journey.\n\nTogether, \"Nero Forte\" encapsulates the idea of a powerful, dark force that is both a significant challenge and a defining element of the individual's experience. The title reflects the song's exploration of intense emotional struggles and the battle against an overpowering internal darkness.",

It is entirely black with some white on its chin while the Brown-headed spider monkey (A. f. fusciceps) has a black or brown body and a brown head.\n\nThe spider monkey has a black body and long limbs with thumb-less hands.  It has a prehensile and extremely flexible tail, which acts as an extra limb.  The tail has a hairless patch on the tip that is used for grip.  This hairless patch is unique in its markings, just like the human fingerprint.  Colombian spider monkeys can weigh up to 9.1 kg (20 pounds).  Fruit makes up eighty percent of the spider monkey's diet, which also includes leaves, nuts, seeds, bark, insects, and flowers. Spider monkeys contribute to the dispersion of undigested seeds from the fruits they eat.

                "original_answer": "The Colombian spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps rufiventris) primarily inhabits dry forests, humid forests, and cloud forests. These diverse habitats provide the necessary resources for their survival, such as food, shelter, and opportunities for social interaction.\n\n### Primary Habitats:\n1. **Dry Forests**: These forests experience seasonal variations in rainfall and have a mix of deciduous and evergreen trees. The dry forests provide a variety of fruits and seeds that are essential to the spider monkey's diet.\n\n2. **Humid Forests**: These are tropical rainforests with high levels of rainfall throughout the year. The dense canopy and rich biodiversity offer an abundance of fruits, leaves, and other food sources. The complex structure of these forests also provides ample opportunities for brachiation (hand-over-hand movement) and other forms of locomotion.\n\n3. **Cloud Forests**: Located at higher elevations, cloud forests are characterized by persistent cloud cover at the canopy level. These forests are rich in epiphytes, mosses, and other plant species, providing a unique and diverse food supply. The cooler and more humid conditions also support a different array of flora and fauna compared to lower elevation forests.\n\n### Contribution to the Ecosystem:\n1. **Seed Dispersal**: One of the most significant ecological roles of the Colombian spider monkey is seed dispersal. As frugivores, they consume a large quantity of fruit and subsequently disperse the undigested seeds through their feces. This process helps in the regeneration and spread of various plant species, contributing to forest diversity and health.\n\n2. **Nutrient Cycling**: By consuming a variety of plant materials and insects, spider monkeys contribute to the nutrient cycling within their habitats. Their waste products return nutrients to the soil, which supports plant growth and maintains the overall health of the forest ecosystem.\n\n3. **Habitat Structure**: The movement and foraging behavior of spider monkeys can influence the structure of the forest. By breaking branches and creating pathways, they can affect the light penetration and growth patterns of the understory vegetation.\n\n4. **Prey and Predator Dynamics**: As part of the food web, spider monkeys serve as prey for larger predators such as jaguars and eagles. Their presence helps maintain the balance of predator-prey relationships within their ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, the Colombian spider monkey plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and diversity of their habitats through seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and influencing forest structure. Their presence is vital for the ecological balance and sustainability of the forests they inhabit.",

                "original_answer": "The primary advantage of using soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) testing over ferritin testing in the investigation of iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with preexisting inflammatory states, lies in the fact that sTfR is insensitive to inflammation. Here are the key points that highlight this advantage:\n\n1. **Insensitivity to Inflammation**: Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, meaning its levels can be elevated in response to inflammation, infection, or other stressors. This elevation can mask true iron deficiency, leading to a false indication that iron stores are adequate. In contrast, sTfR levels are not influenced by inflammatory states, providing a more accurate reflection of iron status in such conditions.\n\n2. **Distinguishing Anemia Types**: sTfR testing is particularly useful in distinguishing between anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). In ACD, ferritin levels may be elevated due to inflammation, while sTfR levels remain unaffected, thus helping to identify true iron deficiency.\n\n3. **Functional Iron Status**: sTfR levels correlate with the body's demand for iron and erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). Elevated sTfR levels indicate increased erythropoietic activity and iron deficiency at the cellular level, providing a functional measure of iron status that is not confounded by inflammation.\n\n4. **Clinical Utility**: In patients with chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic infections, or malignancies, where inflammation is common, sTfR testing can be a more reliable indicator of iron deficiency. This helps in making more accurate clinical decisions regarding iron supplementation and management of anemia.\n\nIn summary, the advantage of sTfR testing over ferritin testing in patients with preexisting inflammatory states is its ability to provide a more accurate assessment of iron deficiency by being unaffected by inflammation, thereby improving the diagnosis and management of anemia in these patients.",

It became commonly known as the Fortress of Hunger (Fortaleza del hambre). The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island. Charles III of Spain, who was concerned for the plight of the islanders, ordered that the fortress be built.\n \nSituated on a cliff above the Port of Naos, the D shaped fort has semi-circular walls facing the sea. On the landward side, the rear wall is protected by two small turrets, with a moat crossed by a lifting drawbridge leading to the main gateway. The fortress is constructed of masonry and ashlar blocks of volcanic origin. The interior which is made up of barrel vaulted rooms was mainly used as a powder store.\n\nInternational Museum of Contemporary Art\nIn the 1970s the fortress was renovated and the interior redesigned by the artist César Manrique, who was born nearby, to house a museum of modern art.  The museum opened to the public in 1976 as the International Museum of Contemporary Art (, abbreviated as MIAC).\n\nThe exhibits are primarily from the period between 1950 and 1980, with a focus on various abstract art forms, such as modern sculpture, kinetic art, and geometric abstraction.

                "original_answer": "Henry Dale and Otto Loewi made seminal contributions to the field of autopharmacology through their groundbreaking research on neurotransmitters, which are endogenous chemical messengers that regulate various physiological functions.\n\n### Henry Dale's Contributions:\n1. **Discovery of Acetylcholine**: Henry Dale was instrumental in identifying acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. He discovered its role in synaptic transmission, particularly in the autonomic nervous system.\n2. **Pharmacological Studies**: Dale's work involved studying the effects of acetylcholine on different tissues, which helped establish its role as a chemical messenger in the body.\n\n### Otto Loewi's Contributions:\n1. **Experimental Proof**: Otto Loewi provided experimental proof of the chemical nature of synaptic transmission. In his famous experiment, he demonstrated that stimulating the vagus nerve of a frog's heart released a substance (which he called \"Vagusstoff\") that could slow down the heart rate. This substance was later identified as acetylcholine.\n2. **Discovery of Noradrenaline**: Loewi also discovered another neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (initially named \"Akzeleransstoff\"), which is chemically similar to adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands.\n\n### Recognition:\n- **Nobel Prize**: For their pioneering work in the field of neurotransmission, Henry Dale and Otto Loewi were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1936. Their discoveries laid the foundation for understanding how endogenous chemical factors regulate body functions, a core concept in autopharmacology.\n\n### Impact on Autopharmacology:\n- **Endogenous Chemical Messengers**: Their work highlighted the importance of endogenous chemical messengers in physiological processes, which is a fundamental principle of autopharmacology.\n- **Receptor Theory**: The identification of specific receptors for these neurotransmitters further advanced the understanding of how endogenous substances exert their effects at the cellular level.\n\nIn summary, Henry Dale and Otto Loewi's discoveries of acetylcholine and noradrenaline as neurotransmitters were pivotal in the development of autopharmacology. Their work not only elucidated the mechanisms of synaptic transmission but also underscored the significance of endogenous chemical factors in regulating physiological functions, earning them the Nobel Prize and a lasting legacy in the field.",

Cahill had been Rector of Ryde since 1868, and vicar-general of the diocese since its foundation.\n\nHe was appointed an Auxiliary Bishop of Portsmouth and Titular Bishop of Thagora on 21 March 1900. His consecration to the Episcopate took place on 1 May 1900, the principal consecrator was Francis Bourne, Bishop of Southwark (later Archbishop of Westminster), and the principal co-consecrators were John Cuthbert Hedley, Bishop of Newport and Menevia and Charles Maurice Graham, Coadjutor Bishop of Plymouth. Bishop Vertue died three weeks later. Three months later, Cahill was appointed Bishop of Portsmouth on 30 August 1900.\n\nCahill completed the cathedral by adding the west front, and carried out several important changes in the interior. Cahill's ten year episcopate was marked by the influx of religious communities, owing to the French persecutions. It was thus that the diocese was enriched by the presence of such congregations as the Benedictines of Solesmes, both monks and nuns.

These themes are deeply influenced by their personal background and identity as an Indigenous person of the Anishinaabe (Ojibway) Nation, as well as their experiences as a two-spirited individual.\n\n1. **Culture and Colonization**: Davis's work often explores the impact of colonization on Indigenous cultures and communities. Their heritage and upbringing in the Anishinaabe Nation provide a rich cultural context that informs their artistic expression and activism. By addressing the historical and ongoing effects of colonization, Davis seeks to highlight the resilience and strength of Indigenous peoples.\n\n2. **Sexuality and Gender**: As a two-spirited person, Davis's work frequently addresses issues related to gender and sexuality. The concept of being two-spirited is unique to Indigenous cultures and encompasses a blend of masculine and feminine qualities. This identity allows Davis to challenge and expand conventional understandings of gender and sexuality, advocating for greater acceptance and recognition of diverse identities.\n\n3. **Racial Justice**: Davis's activism and art also focus on racial justice, particularly the experiences and struggles of Indigenous peoples in Canada. Their work aims to raise awareness about systemic racism and the need for social change, often through powerful visual and performance art that engages and educates audiences.\n\nDavis's personal experiences, including being raised by an Anishinaabe artist mother and their own journey through educational institutions like Ryerson University and George Brown College, have shaped their perspective and approach to art and activism. Their role as a parent of three sons further grounds their work in the realities of family and community life.\n\nOverall, Raven Davis's multifaceted identity and personal history deeply influence their artistic and activist endeavors, driving their commitment to social justice and cultural preservation.",

There were many Portuguese associations in the city, representing immigrants from specific regions of Portugal, and the original idea of the founders was to bring these organizations under one roof. The foundation of the Casa de Portugal saw representatives of União Transmontana, Casa do Minho, União Portuguesa, Centro Beirão and Centro do Douro. Other organizations were subsequently invited, but preferred to maintain their regional character and refused. The first president was the philologist Francisco da Luz Rebelo Gonçalves, a professor at the newly founded University of São Paulo, but he remained in office for only 10 months and was succeeded for the interim by Aurélio Martins Arrobas and in 1936 by Fernando Ribeiro Bacellar.\n\nInitially the Casa de Portugal worked at the headquarters of the Casa do Minho and then in rented properties. Through donations from members and bank loans land and buildings were purchased on the Avenida da Liberdade, in the city center in 1943. The inauguration of the headquarters took place on December 27, 1955.\n\nFeatures \nThe headquarters of the Casa de Portugal is a neocolonial building of five floors designed by Portuguese architect Ricardo Severo. The lobby is decorated with paintings depicting Afonso I, the first king of Portugal, and Manuel da Nobrega, a Portuguese Jesuit priest very influential in the early History of Brazil, and who participated in the founding of several cities, such as Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, and many Jesuit Colleges and seminaries. The building also has meeting rooms, a restaurant, theater, gallery exhibition and a ballroom with a capacity for 1,000 people.\n\nThe Casa de Portugal also serves as headquarters for the Council of the Luso-Brazilian Community of São Paulo, the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and the Ombudsman of the Portuguese Community.

It is the 87th film in ESPN's 30 for 30 series. The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nBackground \nIn 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58–7. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.\n\nThe rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.\n\nThe documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.\n\nCast \nCreadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall. The film also features interviews with head coaches Lou Holtz and Jimmy Johnson; Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez; Notre Dame players Chris Zorich, Pat Eilers, Pat Terrell, and Todd Lyght, among others; and Miami players Steve Walsh, Cleveland Gary, and Leon Searcy, among others.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson called Catholics vs. Convicts a \"gripping gridiron drama.\" Sporting News ranks the film \"among the best\" of the 30 for 30 franchise.\n\nReferences \n\nNotre Dame vs. Miami\nMiami Hurricanes football\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish football\n30 for 30\n2016 telev\nWhat controversial event from the 1988 Notre Dame-Miami football game is closely examined in the 2016 documentary \"Catholics vs. Convicts,\" and how did the filmmakers' re-examination of this event impact the perspectives of the coaches and players involved?",

He graduated in 1959 from Utica College.\n\nHe moved to Washington, D.C. in 1960 and soon after was employed at WAVA-FM, where he created the show \"Music Americana, the Folk Music of America.\"  Cerri hosted and produced at several area radio stations, including WHFS-FM and WJMD-FM which changed call sign to WLTT-FM (see WIAD) where the name of his show was shortened to \"Music Americana.\"   He was at WETA-FM from 1970 to 1973 where his brother Bill was also a disc jockey, well known for his classical music show.\n\nCerri had a very humble view of his reputation as an expert, instead typifying his role as a spectator, albeit a professional one.\n\nCerri started the World Folk Music Association with singer-songwriter Tom Paxton in 1982 and Cerri served as its president for much of its existence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Cerri also sponsored monthly musical concerts using the name of his radio show \"Music Americana.\"\n\nCerri retired in the mid-1990s and continued working with the World Folk Music Association (WFMA).

These conditions included:\n\n1. **War with Iraq (Iran-Iraq War)**: The ongoing conflict with Iraq's Baathist government created a highly unstable and dangerous environment, particularly in border regions. Many cities near the border with Iraq were severely damaged or could not hold direct elections due to the war. This necessitated the use of both direct and indirect election methods.\n\n2. **Severe Sanctions**: Iran was under severe political and economic sanctions, which added to the overall strain on the country's resources and infrastructure. These sanctions likely impacted the logistics and administration of the elections.\n\n3. **Political Restrictions**: This election was the first since the 1979 revolution in which only one political party, the Islamic Republican Party, was allowed to participate. Other political parties were banned or dissolved before the election. This restriction on political pluralism meant that the majority of seats were won by independents, with the Islamic Republican Party being the only party to secure seats.\n\n4. **Boycott by the Freedom Movement of Iran**: The Freedom Movement of Iran declared a boycott of the elections after its headquarters was attacked and the authorities refused to permit the party to hold two seminars. This boycott further limited the political diversity and competition in the elections.\n\n5. **Election Methods**: Due to the war, the election process had to be adapted. In areas not heavily affected by the war and for religious minority seats, direct national elections were held. However, in areas heavily affected by the war, mainly in border regions with Iraq, indirect national elections were conducted. Out of 193 constituencies, 187 held direct elections, while six constituencies held indirect elections.\n\n6. **Voter Turnout**: Despite these challenging conditions, voter turnout was relatively high at 65.1% in the first round, indicating a significant level of public participation despite the adversities.\n\nThe unique conditions of war, sanctions, political restrictions, and the need for both direct and indirect election methods created a complex and challenging environment for the 1984 Iranian parliamentary elections. These factors influenced not only the logistics and administration of the elections but also the political landscape and the nature of electoral competition.",

There are 2 vacant anchor store that were once Carson's and Sears. It is managed by T Danville, a division of Tabani Group.\n\nHistory\nVillage Mall was developed in the 1970s by SES Development Company. The first store to open was an Ayr-Way discount store in 1972, which later became Target. It was followed by  a National Supermarkets and a Meis department store, which was later sold to Elder-Beerman. The mall itself opened in 1975. J. C. Penney was added in 1985. Sears, which previously had a store in downtown Danville, was offered an incentive by the city to move to the mall in the early 1990s.\n\nTarget closed in 1997 due to low sales, and by 1999 had become a Hobby Lobby. J. C. Penney closed its Danville store in 2001 along with two others in Illinois. In 2004, a wing of the mall was renovated to make room for a Goody's clothing store. The former J. C. Penney store became Steve & Barry's in 2006. That same year, several anchors were proposed for the mall, including Old Navy and Dunham's Sports. County Market, which replaced National Supermarket, was also expanded.\n\nHobby Lobby, Steve & Barry's, and Goody's all closed in 2008, the latter two due to bankruptcy of the chains. The loss of these stores led to rumors that the mall would close or be converted to other uses, or that Elder-Beerman or Sears would relocate to elsewhere in town.\n\nDespite these closures, Pet Supplies Plus opened in part of the former Hobby Lobby. By 2010, the last restaurant had closed in the food court. Elder-Beerman was re-branded Carson's in 2011, and Dunham's Sports filled the rest of the former Hobby Lobby. The former Goody's space became Ross Dress for Less in mid-2012. In mid-2013, Burlington Coat Factory opened in the former J. C. Penney/Steve & Barry's space. The addition of new stores brought occupancy levels up to 78 percent. In September 2014, Sears announced that it would close the Village Mall store. In mid-2015, a Jo-Ann Fabrics was added to the mall, while the city of Danville offered an incentive to the Slumberland Furniture chain to open a store in part of the former Sears.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, The Bon-Ton Stores announced that Carson's would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2018. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that The Bon-Ton Stores would be going out of business due to bankruptcy.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n\nShopping malls in Illinois\nShopping malls established in 1975\nBuildings and structures in Danville, I\nWhat were the original anchor stores of Village Mall when it first opened in 1975, and how have they changed over the years?",

This development likely aimed to enhance the value and appeal of these residential areas by providing direct access to the lake, thereby promoting recreational activities and potentially increasing property values.",

However, terms like \"dark wave\" (⚫️🌊), \"The Sisters of Mercy\" (💔🕺), and \"Peter Gabriel\" (✨🕴️) were replaced with emojis. The replacement is inconsistent, leading to a score that reflects partial but not complete substitution of technical terms with emojis.",

                "original_answer": "The title \"Nero Forte,\" which translates from Italian to \"black strong\" or \"black force,\" holds significant relevance to the song's themes and lyrics. Although the title itself does not appear in the lyrics, it metaphorically encapsulates the essence of the song's subject matter. \n\nThe term \"Nero\" (black) symbolizes the darkness and depression that Corey Taylor, the band's lead vocalist, describes sinking into. This darkness is portrayed as an overwhelming and consuming force, akin to an entity that Taylor felt powerless against. The use of \"black\" effectively conveys the depth and intensity of the emotional struggle and the bleakness of the mental state he experienced.\n\n\"Forte\" (strong) can be interpreted in two ways. Firstly, it signifies the strength and intensity of the depression, emphasizing how powerful and dominating this dark force was in Taylor's life. Secondly, \"forte\" can also mean something in which one excels, which might suggest a duality where the struggle with darkness is a significant and defining part of Taylor's personal and artistic journey.\n\nTogether, \"Nero Forte\" encapsulates the idea of a powerful, dark force that is both a significant challenge and a defining element of the individual's experience. The title reflects the song's exploration of intense emotional struggles and the battle against an overpowering internal darkness.",

These habitats contribute to the ecosystem by supporting the spider monkey's role in seed dispersion, which helps maintain forest diversity and regeneration.",
                "original_answer": "The Colombian spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps rufiventris) primarily inhabits dry forests, humid forests, and cloud forests. These diverse habitats provide the necessary resources for their survival, such as food, shelter, and opportunities for social interaction.\n\n### Primary Habitats:\n1. **Dry Forests**: These forests experience seasonal variations in rainfall and have a mix of deciduous and evergreen trees. The dry forests provide a variety of fruits and seeds that are essential to the spider monkey's diet.\n\n2. **Humid Forests**: These are tropical rainforests with high levels of rainfall throughout the year. The dense canopy and rich biodiversity offer an abundance of fruits, leaves, and other food sources. The complex structure of these forests also provides ample opportunities for brachiation (hand-over-hand movement) and other forms of locomotion.\n\n3. **Cloud Forests**: Located at higher elevations, cloud forests are characterized by persistent cloud cover at the canopy level. These forests are rich in epiphytes, mosses, and other plant species, providing a unique and diverse food supply. The cooler and more humid conditions also support a different array of flora and fauna compared to lower elevation forests.\n\n### Contribution to the Ecosystem:\n1. **Seed Dispersal**: One of the most significant ecological roles of the Colombian spider monkey is seed dispersal. As frugivores, they consume a large quantity of fruit and subsequently disperse the undigested seeds through their feces. This process helps in the regeneration and spread of various plant species, contributing to forest diversity and health.\n\n2. **Nutrient Cycling**: By consuming a variety of plant materials and insects, spider monkeys contribute to the nutrient cycling within their habitats. Their waste products return nutrients to the soil, which supports plant growth and maintains the overall health of the forest ecosystem.\n\n3. **Habitat Structure**: The movement and foraging behavior of spider monkeys can influence the structure of the forest. By breaking branches and creating pathways, they can affect the light penetration and growth patterns of the understory vegetation.\n\n4. **Prey and Predator Dynamics**: As part of the food web, spider monkeys serve as prey for larger predators such as jaguars and eagles. Their presence helps maintain the balance of predator-prey relationships within their ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, the Colombian spider monkey plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and diversity of their habitats through seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and influencing forest structure. Their presence is vital for the ecological balance and sustainability of the forests they inhabit.",

The structure and content of both texts are otherwise very similar, with the main difference being the substitution of technical terms with emojis in Text1.

It has been demonstrated to deliver more transferrin as compared to the receptors anchored on the cells surface in numerous cell types.\n\nSee also\nFerritin\nTransferrin\nTotal iron binding capacity\n\nCitations\n\nP\nWhat is the advantage of using 🔬💧🔩 (sTfR) testing over ⚖️💸📈 testing in the 🔍️🕵️‍♀️🔎 of iron deficiency 🤯💔👀, particularly in patients with preexisting inflammatory states?",

                "deobfuscated_answer": "The advantage of using soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) testing over ferritin testing in the investigation of iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with preexisting inflammatory states, is that sTfR is insensitive to inflammation. This means it can accurately detect anemia even when inflammation is present, whereas ferritin levels may be falsely elevated due to inflammation, leading to incorrect conclusions about iron stores.",
                "original_answer": "The primary advantage of using soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) testing over ferritin testing in the investigation of iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with preexisting inflammatory states, lies in the fact that sTfR is insensitive to inflammation. Here are the key points that highlight this advantage:\n\n1. **Insensitivity to Inflammation**: Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, meaning its levels can be elevated in response to inflammation, infection, or other stressors. This elevation can mask true iron deficiency, leading to a false indication that iron stores are adequate. In contrast, sTfR levels are not influenced by inflammatory states, providing a more accurate reflection of iron status in such conditions.\n\n2. **Distinguishing Anemia Types**: sTfR testing is particularly useful in distinguishing between anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). In ACD, ferritin levels may be elevated due to inflammation, while sTfR levels remain unaffected, thus helping to identify true iron deficiency.\n\n3. **Functional Iron Status**: sTfR levels correlate with the body's demand for iron and erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). Elevated sTfR levels indicate increased erythropoietic activity and iron deficiency at the cellular level, providing a functional measure of iron status that is not confounded by inflammation.\n\n4. **Clinical Utility**: In patients with chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic infections, or malignancies, where inflammation is common, sTfR testing can be a more reliable indicator of iron deficiency. This helps in making more accurate clinical decisions regarding iron supplementation and management of anemia.\n\nIn summary, the advantage of sTfR testing over ferritin testing in patients with preexisting inflammatory states is its ability to provide a more accurate assessment of iron deficiency by being unaffected by inflammation, thereby improving the diagnosis and management of anemia in these patients.",

The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island.

                "original_answer": "Henry Dale and Otto Loewi made seminal contributions to the field of autopharmacology through their groundbreaking research on neurotransmitters, which are endogenous chemical messengers that regulate various physiological functions.\n\n### Henry Dale's Contributions:\n1. **Discovery of Acetylcholine**: Henry Dale was instrumental in identifying acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. He discovered its role in synaptic transmission, particularly in the autonomic nervous system.\n2. **Pharmacological Studies**: Dale's work involved studying the effects of acetylcholine on different tissues, which helped establish its role as a chemical messenger in the body.\n\n### Otto Loewi's Contributions:\n1. **Experimental Proof**: Otto Loewi provided experimental proof of the chemical nature of synaptic transmission. In his famous experiment, he demonstrated that stimulating the vagus nerve of a frog's heart released a substance (which he called \"Vagusstoff\") that could slow down the heart rate. This substance was later identified as acetylcholine.\n2. **Discovery of Noradrenaline**: Loewi also discovered another neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (initially named \"Akzeleransstoff\"), which is chemically similar to adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands.\n\n### Recognition:\n- **Nobel Prize**: For their pioneering work in the field of neurotransmission, Henry Dale and Otto Loewi were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1936. Their discoveries laid the foundation for understanding how endogenous chemical factors regulate body functions, a core concept in autopharmacology.\n\n### Impact on Autopharmacology:\n- **Endogenous Chemical Messengers**: Their work highlighted the importance of endogenous chemical messengers in physiological processes, which is a fundamental principle of autopharmacology.\n- **Receptor Theory**: The identification of specific receptors for these neurotransmitters further advanced the understanding of how endogenous substances exert their effects at the cellular level.\n\nIn summary, Henry Dale and Otto Loewi's discoveries of acetylcholine and noradrenaline as neurotransmitters were pivotal in the development of autopharmacology. Their work not only elucidated the mechanisms of synaptic transmission but also underscored the significance of endogenous chemical factors in regulating physiological functions, earning them the Nobel Prize and a lasting legacy in the field.",

There were many Portuguese associations in the city, representing immigrants from specific regions of Portugal, and the original idea of the founders was to bring these organizations under one roof. The foundation of the Casa de Portugal saw representatives of União Transmontana, Casa do Minho, União Portuguesa, Centro Beirão and Centro do Douro. Other organizations were subsequently invited, but preferred to maintain their regional character and refused. The first president was the philologist Francisco da Luz Rebelo Gonçalves, a professor at the newly founded University of São Paulo, but he remained in office for only 10 months and was succeeded for the interim by Aurélio Martins Arrobas and in 1936 by Fernando Ribeiro Bacellar.\n\nInitially the Casa de Portugal worked at the headquarters of the Casa do Minho and then in rented properties.

The building also has meeting rooms, a restaurant, theater, gallery exhibition and a ballroom with a capacity for 1,000 people.\n\nThe Casa de Portugal also serves as headquarters for the Council of the Luso-Brazilian Community of São Paulo, the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and the Ombudsman of the Portuguese Community.

The dark D-type asteroid belongs to the 20 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 10.15 hours. It was named after the Greek hero and great archer, Teucer.\n\nOrbit and classification \n\nTeucer is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's  Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.6 AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,213 days; semi-major axis of 5.1 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first observation as  at Turku Observatory in December 1940, more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Teucer, from Greek mythology. The son of King Telamon was a great archer and half-brother of Ajax, with whom he fought alongside in the Trojan War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 17 February 1984 ().\n\nPhysical characteristics \n\nTeucer has been characterized as a dark D-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS' survey as well as in the SDSS-based taxonomy. It is also an assumed C-type asteroid.\n\nRotation period \n\nSeveral rotational lightcurves of Teucer have been obtained from photometric observations since 1992. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve from September 2010, by Daniel Coley at the Center for Solar System Studies  gave a well-defined rotation period of  hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 magnitude ().\n\nDiameter and albedo \n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Teucer measures between 89.43 and 113.99 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.059 and 0.073.\n\nThe Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0435 and a diameter of 110.72 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.8.

There are 2 vacant anchor store that were once Carson's and Sears. It is managed by T Danville, a division of Tabani Group.\n\nHistory\nVillage Mall was developed in the 1970s by SES Development Company. The first store to open was an Ayr-Way discount store in 1972, which later became Target. It was followed by  a National Supermarkets and a Meis department store, which was later sold to Elder-Beerman. The mall itself opened in 1975. J. C. Penney was added in 1985. Sears, which previously had a store in downtown Danville, was offered an incentive by the city to move to the mall in the early 1990s.\n\nTarget closed in 1997 due to low sales, and by 1999 had become a Hobby Lobby. J. C. Penney closed its Danville store in 2001 along with two others in Illinois. In 2004, a wing of the mall was renovated to make room for a Goody's clothing store. The former J. C. Penney store became Steve & Barry's in 2006. That same year, several anchors were proposed for the mall, including Old Navy and Dunham's Sports. County Market, which replaced National Supermarket, was also expanded.\n\nHobby Lobby, Steve & Barry's, and Goody's all closed in 2008, the latter two due to bankruptcy of the chains. The loss of these stores led to rumors that the mall would close or be converted to other uses, or that Elder-Beerman or Sears would relocate to elsewhere in town.\n\nDespite these closures, Pet Supplies Plus opened in part of the former Hobby Lobby. By 2010, the last restaurant had closed in the food court. Elder-Beerman was re-branded Carson's in 2011, and Dunham's Sports filled the rest of the former Hobby Lobby. The former Goody's space became Ross Dress for Less in mid-2012. In mid-2013, Burlington Coat Factory opened in the former J. C. Penney/Steve & Barry's space. The addition of new stores brought occupancy levels up to 78 percent. In September 2014, Sears announced that it would close the Village Mall store. In mid-2015, a Jo-Ann Fabrics was added to the mall, while the city of Danville offered an incentive to the Slumberland Furniture chain to open a store in part of the former Sears.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, The Bon-Ton Stores announced that Carson's would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2018. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that The Bon-Ton Stores would be going out of business due to bankruptcy.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n\nShopping malls in Illinois\nShopping malls established in 1975\nBuildings and structures in Danville, Illinois",

Both texts also mention the station's historical construction in 1900 and its architectural style. Additionally, they touch upon the station's connections to local transit routes. The main differences are in the level of detail and specific phrasing, but the core information and topics covered are very much aligned."

It is a follow up to 2013's Hubardo. It's the first album from Kayo Dot to not be self-released since 2012's Gamma Knife. Coffins on Io marks a notable change in sound. It combines influences of Type O Negative, The Sisters of Mercy, Peter Gabriel, dark wave and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of electronic music, jazz fusion, post-punk, gothic rock and new wave.  It was produced by Toby Driver.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on The Flenser for one of Driver's other bands, Vaura, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album. Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDriver has said that the album was influenced by dark wave as well as Type O Negative, Peter Gabriel and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by dark wave and was written as evoking \"1980s retrofuture noir.\"\n\nDriver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of Hubardo resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior Kayo Dot albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior Kayo Dot albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically Blade Runner.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through The Flenser. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in MP3, FLAC, CD and LP. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction. Empty Lighthouse called it \"Kayo Dot's best album to date\" and celebrates its ability to \"nail the noir feel,\" describing the album as \"Lynchian\". Re-views Media writer Michael Snoxall gave the album four stars out of five, saying the album feels familiar yet alien at the same time, and that the album is a \"monumental\" and \"towering achievement.\" SputnikMusic gave it a 4/5, saying it \"hums with sleek resonance\" and calling the album \"vibrant and exciting.\"\n\nTrack listing\nMusic by Toby Driver.

It combines influences of 🩸🚫, 👭🙏, 🎤👼, 🌑🌊 and other 80s electronic musicians. It combines aspects of 🎹⚡, 🎷🔀, 📯🖤, 🏰🎸 and 🌊🆕.  It was produced by 🎤🚗.\n\nWriting and recording\nAfter releasing an album on 🏷️🔪 for one of Driver's other bands, 🎸🌸, Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the 🎶🔵 moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album. Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDriver has said that the album was influenced by 🌑🌊 as well as 🩸🚫, 🎤👼 and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by 🌑🌊 and was written as evoking \"📼🔮🖤.\"\n\nDriver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of 📀🌑 resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior 🎶🔵 albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior 🎶🔵 albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically 🗡️🏃.\n\nRelease and reception\nThe album was released on October 15 through 🏷️🔪. It is available for purchase on 🏷️🔪's site and 🎶🔵's bandcamp in 🎵3️⃣, 🎵🔲, 💿 and 📀. The album has received positive reviews, many praising the band's shift in music direction. 🏠🚫💡 called it \"🎶🔵's best album to date\" and celebrates its ability to \"nail the noir feel,\" describing the album as \"🎥🌀\". 🔄📺 writer 🧔⭐ gave the album four stars out of five, saying the album feels familiar yet alien at the same time, and that the album is a \"monumental\" and \"towering achievement.\" 🛰️🎶 gave it a 4/5, saying it \"hums with sleek resonance\" and calling the album \"vibrant and exciting.\"\n\nTrack listing\nMusic by 🎤🚗.

The depression was like an entity that he did not feel he had the strength to fight against. When talking about the song, guitarist Jim Root stated: \"This is also a Clown song, which is amazing. This one is going to be great live. It's very percussive and reminiscent of \"Psychosocial\", but maybe an evolution of \"Psychosocial\". Obviously, Clown is a drummer and percussionist, but he's also a songwriter—and he always has been. Now we're able to collaborate as songwriters, and this is what we end up with.

That really drew me into this song.\"\n\nMusic video  \nShawn Crahan, Slipknot's percussionist and founder, directed the video along with a 20 minute short film titled Pollution, which would be released on the same day as the \"Nero Forte\". They were both recorded within two days, on both the 29th and 30 October. They were both initially to be released at some point during November, but for some reasons they did not come into fruition until a later date.\n\nThe \"Nero Forte\" music video stars the band, who jam out and perform in a white limbo, constantly flashed by coloured beaming lights, at points surrounding what seems to be a fan inside of a cocoon, which has something inside which appears to try to be trying to escape and be reborn.\n\nAs of December 2021, the song has 40 million views on YouTube.\n\nCharts\n\nReferences \n\nSongs written by Corey Taylor\nSongs written by Jim Root\nSongs written by Shawn Crahan\n2019 songs\n2019 singles\nSlipknot (band) songs\nRoadrunner Records singles",

It became commonly known as the Fortress of Hunger (Fortaleza del hambre). The famine was caused by a number of factors including periods of drought, and the earlier eruption of Timanfaya between 1730 and 1736, which devastated most of the productive agricultural areas on the island. Charles III of Spain, who was concerned for the plight of the islanders, ordered that the fortress be built.\n \nSituated on a cliff above the Port of Naos, the D shaped fort has semi-circular walls facing the sea. On the landward side, the rear wall is protected by two small turrets, with a moat crossed by a lifting drawbridge leading to the main gateway. The fortress is constructed of masonry and ashlar blocks of volcanic origin. The interior which is made up of barrel vaulted rooms was mainly used as a powder store.\n\nInternational Museum of Contemporary Art\nIn the 1970s the fortress was renovated and the interior redesigned by the artist César Manrique, who was born nearby, to house a museum of modern art.  The museum opened to the public in 1976 as the International Museum of Contemporary Art (, abbreviated as MIAC).\n\nThe exhibits are primarily from the period between 1950 and 1980, with a focus on various abstract art forms, such as modern sculpture, kinetic art, and geometric abstraction. The works are mainly by Spanish artists including Joan Miró,  Antoni Tàpies, Eusebio Sempere and the El Paso group, one section is also dedicated to the Canarian artist Pancho Lasso.\n\nThe courtyard is also used as a display space for outdoor sculptures and designs.\nBeneath the museum, the annexe of the fort was renovated and converted into a restaurant, the two  connected by a spiral staircase. With curved floor to ceiling windows, the dining room has panoramic views overlooking the harbour and docks below.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nArrecife\nMuseums in the Canary Islands\nModern art museums in Spain\nCastles in Canary Islands\nBien de Interés Cultural landmarks in the Province of Las Palmas\nBuildings and structures in Lanzarote\nTourist attractions in Lanzarote",

A more restricted definition would consider substances that were first identified as external agents which had a documented action on physiological functions, but later were discovered as existing as endogenous factors. The best example is the class of endorphins, which, as its name implies, were discovered to exist in the brain and have specific receptors in it, by investigations on the mechanism of action of opioids, such as morphine.\n\nHistorically, the first approach to the concept of autopharmacology began with British physiologist and pharmacologist Henry Dale in the 1910s, discovered the role of acetylcholine in synaptic transmission, and later proved by Austrian physiologist Otto Loewi, to be the neurotransmitter involved in the proximal synapses of the autonomic nervous system (initially named Vagusstoff by Loewi, and later identified as acetylcholine). The same happened to another autonomic neurotransmitter, noradrenaline (Akzeleransstoff by Loewi), which later proved to be chemically similar to a long used pharmacological agent, adrenaline, a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands. Both scientists were awarded the 1936 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their pioneering and important contributions.\n\nA research area where autopharmacology principles assumed great importance was that of pain and inflammation, due to the great number of endogenous messengers, transmitters and modulators involved in their complex response at molecular and cellular level. The control and regulation mechanisms of the circulatory system and renal functions and their interactions (such as the renin/angiotensin system) are also greatly influenced by autopharmacological agents; One of the autopharmacology pioneers was Professor Mauricio Rocha e Silva, leader of the team of Brazilian researchers who discovered bradykinin in 1948, an endogenous substance involved in hypotension in circulatory shock.

There were many Portuguese associations in the city, representing immigrants from specific regions of Portugal, and the original idea of the founders was to bring these organizations under one roof. The foundation of the Casa de Portugal saw representatives of União Transmontana, Casa do Minho, União Portuguesa, Centro Beirão and Centro do Douro.

It is the 87th film in ESPN's 30 for 30 series. The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nBackground \nIn 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58–7. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.\n\nThe rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.\n\nThe documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.\n\nCast \nCreadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall. The film also features interviews with head coaches Lou Holtz and Jimmy Johnson; Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez; Notre Dame players Chris Zorich, Pat Eilers, Pat Terrell, and Todd Lyght, among others; and Miami players Steve Walsh, Cleveland Gary, and Leon Searcy, among others.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson called Catholics vs. Convicts a \"gripping gridiron drama.\" Sporting News ranks the film \"among the best\" of the 30 for 30 franchise.\n\nReferences \n\nNotre Dame vs. Miami\nMiami Hurricanes football\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish football\n30 for 30\n2016 television films",

It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.6 AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,213 days; semi-major axis of 5.1 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first observation as  at Turku Observatory in December 1940, more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Teucer, from Greek mythology.

While the station has a waiting room, it is only open in early mornings and late evenings, half an hour before the first westbound and eastbound train arrives. It does not have a ticket agent, but the station does have personnel that can assist riders upon departure and arrival. The station is directly across the tracks from the National New York Central Railroad Museum.\n\nHistory \nElkhart station was originally built in 1900 by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and had a freight house installed across the tracks in 1907. The building is constructed of red brick trimmed with limestone, which is used for the window surrounds and belt course. The station was originally set amid a well-kept garden that displayed neat beds of colorful flowers and a row of trees along the tracks; this manicured landscape was not only a pretty introduction to the city for first time visitors, but it also buffered the streets of downtown from the noise and dirt associated with steam engines and freight trains. The station and the railroad were acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1914. NYC merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, and passenger service was taken over by Amtrak in 1971. The freight house became the National NYC Museum in 1987.\n\nTransit connections \n\nMACOG Interurban Trolley's Elkhart-Goshen and Concord routes both stop near the station. However, because of the way the train schedules are currently set up, riders can only connect to westbound trains. Riders who wish to board eastbound trains would have to arrive several hours ahead of time.

The station is directly across the tracks from the 🏛️🔧.\n\nHistory \nElkhart station was originally built in 1900 by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and had a 🏠🚂 installed across the tracks in 1907. The building is constructed of 🔥🏗️ trimmed with 💎🏰, which is used for the 🌆️🏞️ and 🏋️‍♀️💪. The station was originally set amid a well-kept garden that displayed neat beds of colorful flowers and a row of trees along the tracks; this manicured landscape was not only a pretty introduction to the city for first time visitors, but it also buffered the streets of downtown from the noise and dirt associated with ⚙️☁️ and 🚂📦. The station and the railroad were acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1914. NYC merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, and passenger service was taken over by Amtrak in 1971. The 🏠🚂 became the National NYC Museum in 1987.\n\nTransit connections \n\n🚌🗺️'s Elkhart-Goshen and Concord routes both stop near the station. However, because of the way the train schedules are currently set up, riders can only connect to ⏰🚂.

It has smooth white to cream-coloured bark that is shed in ribbons, sometimes with rough, fibrous or flaky bark at the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green leaves that are a paler shade on the lower side, egg-shaped to lance-shaped or elliptical,  long and  wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to  long. Mature buds are oval,  long and  wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering has been recorded in October and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped or urn-shaped capsule  long and  wide\nwith the valves below the level of the rim.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus olsenii was first formally described in 1980 by Lawrie Johnsone and Don Blaxell in the journal Telopea.

However, not all technical terms have been replaced with emojis, and some replacements may not be immediately clear or intuitive.
