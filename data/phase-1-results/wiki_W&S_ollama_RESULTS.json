There were many Portuguese associations in the city, representing immigrants from specific regions of Portugal, and the original idea of the founders was to bring these organizations under one roof. The foundation of the Casa de Portugal saw representatives of União Transmontana, Casa do Minho, União Portuguesa, Centro Beirão and Centro do Douro. Other organizations were subsequently invited, but preferred to maintain their regional character and refused. The first president was the philologist Francisco da Luz Rebelo Gonçalves, a professor at the newly founded University of São Paulo, but he remained in office for only 10 months and was succeeded for the interim by Aurélio Martins Arrobas and in 1936 by Fernando Ribeiro Bacellar.\n\nInitially the Casa de Portugal worked at the headquarters of the Casa do Minho and then in rented properties. Through donations from members and bank loans land and buildings were purchased on the Avenida da Liberdade, in the city center in 1943. The inauguration of the headquarters took place on December 27, 1955.\n\nFeatures \nThe headquarters of the Casa de Portugal is a neocolonial building of five floors designed by Portuguese architect Ricardo Severo. The lobby is decorated with paintings depicting Afonso I, the first king of Portugal, and Manuel da Nobrega, a Portuguese Jesuit priest very influential in the early History of Brazil, and who participated in the founding of several cities, such as Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, and many Jesuit Colleges and seminaries. The building also has meeting rooms, a restaurant, theater, gallery exhibition and a ballroom with a capacity for 1,000 people.\n\nThe Casa de Portugal also serves as headquarters for the Council of the Luso-Brazilian Community of São Paulo, the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce and the Ombudsman of the Portuguese Community. It was also headquarters for the Consulate of Portugal in São Paulo and the Camões Institute, but these institutions have moved to a building in the Jardim América area in 2004.\n\nLibrary \nThe creation of a library for the Casa de Portugal had been planned since its foundation, when the partners began to donate books to the collection. In 1957 the library was opened, and in 1991 it was extended with an auditorium and reading room.

The film was aired on ESPN directly after the 2016 Heisman Award Ceremony and premiered to over 2 million viewers, making it the highest rated 30 for 30 film since 2015.  At the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards it was one of that season's 30 for 30 films nominated for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nBackground \nIn 1985, a rivalry started between the University of Notre Dame and University of Miami football teams after the Miami Hurricanes beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 58–7. This loss marked head coach Gerry Faust's last game at Notre Dame.\n\nThe rivalry culminated in a showdown three years later, which was dubbed \"Catholics vs. Convicts.\" The name originated from a t-shirt slogan created by Notre Dame students Joe Frederick and Michael Caponigro. The slogan played on Notre Dame's Catholic background and the public perception of Miami's players as college football's \"bad boys,\" a reputation that was reinforced by the arrests of a number of Miami players. Both the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Miami Hurricanes came into the game undefeated. Cleveland Gary's controversial \"phantom fumble\" is examined closely in the film.  While studying the game the filmmakers re-examined a second close call by the referees which had gone largely unnoticed at the time.  Both coaches and several players from the game had never seen the replay, leading many of the subjects to reconsider the outcome of the game. Many sportswriters consider it one of the greatest college football games of all time.\n\nThe documentary is partially based on director Patrick Creadon's experience as a Notre Dame undergraduate at the time. Creadon was a senior at Notre Dame in 1988 and knew the students behind the \"Catholics vs. Convicts\" slogan.\n\nCast \nCreadon went back to interview several of his classmates for the documentary, including Patrick Walsh, his best friend from high school who was involved in the t-shirt scandal, and Tony Rice, the starting quarterback who lived down the hall from them in Dillon Hall. The film also features interviews with head coaches Lou Holtz and Jimmy Johnson; Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez; Notre Dame players Chris Zorich, Pat Eilers, Pat Terrell, and Todd Lyght, among others; and Miami players Steve Walsh, Cleveland Gary, and Leon Searcy, among others.\n\nReception \nWriting for The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson called Catholics vs. Convicts a \"gripping gridiron drama.\" Sporting News ranks the film \"among the best\" of the 30 for 30 franchise.\n\nReferences \n\nNotre Dame vs. Miami\nMiami Hurricanes football\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish football\n30 for 30\n2016 television films",

It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.6 AU once every 11 years and 6 months (4,213 days; semi-major axis of 5.1 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic.\n\nThe body's observation arc begins with its first observation as  at Turku Observatory in December 1940, more than 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.\n\nNaming \n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Teucer, from Greek mythology.

The station is directly across the tracks from the National New York Central Railroad Museum.\n\nHistory \nElkhart station was originally built in 1900 by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway and had a freight house installed across the tracks in 1907. The building is constructed of red brick trimmed with limestone, which is used for the window surrounds and belt course. The station was originally set amid a well-kept garden that displayed neat beds of colorful flowers and a row of trees along the tracks; this manicured landscape was not only a pretty introduction to the city for first time visitors, but it also buffered the streets of downtown from the noise and dirt associated with steam engines and freight trains. The station and the railroad were acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1914. NYC merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968, and passenger service was taken over by Amtrak in 1971. The freight house became the National NYC Museum in 1987.\n\nTransit connections \n\nMACOG Interurban Trolley's Elkhart-Goshen and Concord routes both stop near the station. However, because of the way the train schedules are currently set up, riders can only connect to westbound trains. Riders who wish to board eastbound trains would have to arrive several hours ahead of time. Elkhart-Goshen route connects to westbound Capitol Limited and Lake Shore Limited trains, while Concord route can only connect to westbound Lake Shore Limited train.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nElkart Amtrak Station (USA Rail Guide -- Train Web)\nElkhart Station (EKH) Great American Stations (Amtrak)\nNational New York Central Railroad Museum (Official Site)\n\nAmtrak stations in Indiana\nFormer New York Central Railroad stations\nRailway stations in the United States opened in 1900\nTransportation in Elkhart, Indiana\nTransportation buildings and structures in Elkhart County, Indiana",

It has smooth white to cream-coloured bark that is shed in ribbons, sometimes with rough, fibrous or flaky bark at the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green leaves that are a paler shade on the lower side, egg-shaped to lance-shaped or elliptical,  long and  wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved,  long and  wide on a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to  long. Mature buds are oval,  long and  wide with a conical to beaked operculum. Flowering has been recorded in October and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped or urn-shaped capsule  long and  wide\nwith the valves below the level of the rim.\n\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus olsenii was first formally described in 1980 by Lawrie Johnsone and Don Blaxell in the journal Telopea.

However, not all technical terms have been replaced with emojis, and some replacements may not be immediately clear or intuitive.
