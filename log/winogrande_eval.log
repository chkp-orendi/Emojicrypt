    encrypted_option_1: Ethan
    encrypted_option_2: Dennis
    original_prompt_answer: A funny one!

Let's think step by step... The sentence says "after already having a bowl" which means Ian had already eaten some of the menudo. Then, he volunteered to eat more (Dennis's portion). So, who despised eating intestine? If it was Ian, he wouldn't have eaten his own portion in the first place! Therefore, it must be...

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A fun one! ü§î

Let's break it down step by step:

* "Ethan üç¥" means Ethan is the one eating.
* The sentence mentions Sammy's menudo, which implies that Sammy is the one who made/has the menudo.
* After already having a bowl, Ethan wants to eat more. This suggests that Ethan had some of the menudo earlier.
* Lily üòù (is disgusted) üçî (with food) üöΩ (the toilet). This indicates that Lily has thrown up or is going to throw up.

Putting it all together, we can conclude that Lily must have eaten Sammy's menudo and now feels sick. Therefore, the person who had already eaten some of the menudo before wanting more is... Lily! üòä

However, according to the options, the correct answer is:

    encrypted_option_1: Ethan
    encrypted_option_2: somewhere
    original_prompt_answer: I think I have it!

Since Ian is the one who volunteered to eat the menudo, and he didn't enjoy eating it because it contains intestine, the correct answer is:

Ian did not enjoy eating intestine.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let me think step by step!

The sentence says that someone (Ethan) volunteered to eat somewhere's food after already having a bowl. This means that the person who already had a bowl is the one who enjoys eating intestine. The correct answer should be the word that fits this description.

Option 1: Ethan doesn't enjoy eating intestine, it's actually the other way around - someone else enjoys eating intestine.

Option 2: somewhere refers to an unknown or unnamed place, but it can't enjoy eating intestine either!

So, I'm going with...

    option1: home
    option2: house
    answer: 1

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'He': 'Ruth', '_': 'Sammy'}

    encrypted_sentence: Ruth never comes to my home, but I always go to his house because the Sammy is smaller.
    encrypted_option_1: home
    encrypted_option_2: house
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step:

The sentence starts with "He never comes to my...", which means he doesn't visit me at my place. This implies that my home is not a convenient or preferred location for him.

The reason why I always go to his house, according to the text, is because "the [blank] is smaller". This suggests that his house is smaller than mine.

Given this information, we can infer that "my home" must be larger than his house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: $2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

The text says "Ruth never comes to my _______" which suggests that it's referring to a place where Ruth visits or spends time. Then, it says "but I always go to his _______" which means that the speaker (me) is talking about going somewhere else.

Since Sammy has a house that is smaller than mine, it makes sense that the speaker would say they go to HIS house because it's smaller, not that Ruth comes to their house!

So, my answer is:

    answer: 2

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'his house': 'üè†', 'bigger': 'larger'}

    encrypted_sentence: He never comes to my home, but I always go to üè† because the _ is larger.
    encrypted_option_1: home
    encrypted_option_2: house
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is comparing two things: "He never comes to my __" and "...because the ___ is bigger..."

We know that the person is talking about their own residence ("my home" or "my house"), so it can't be their own place that's bigger. Instead, the comparison suggests that someone else's residence is larger.

This means that when we fill in the blank, we need to choose an option that refers to the other person's residence. In this case, that would be Option 2: "house".

Answer: $2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I need to think step by step. The sentence says "I always go to [blank] because the [blank] is larger...". This means that there's a comparison being made between two places, and one of them has something that makes it more desirable or suitable for the speaker.

In this case, the comparison is between the speaker's home (which He never comes to) and some other place they always go to. The key phrase is "the [blank] is larger...". This implies that the place they always go to has a larger [something], which makes it more appealing or useful for the speaker.

Given this context, I believe the correct answer is:

Option 2: house

This is because "house" is often used to refer to a larger or more impressive structure than a person's home. For example, someone might say "I always go to my friend's house because it has a big backyard" - in this case, the house has something that makes it more desirable (a large yard) compared to the speaker's own home.

    option1: Kyle
    option2: Logan
    answer: 2

    encrypted_sentence: Kaius doesn't wear leg warmers to bed, while Luna almost always does. _ is more likely to live in a ‚ùÑÔ∏è.
    encrypted_option_1: Kaius
    encrypted_option_2: Luna
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

We know that Logan almost always wears leg warmers to bed, which suggests that he might be someone who values warmth and coziness. This makes it more likely for him to live in a colder climate where he would need extra warmth.

On the other hand, Kyle doesn't wear leg warmers to bed, which implies that he might not prioritize warmth as much. He could live anywhere, from a cold climate to a warm one!

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's analyze the information:

* Kaius doesn't wear leg warmers to bed.
* Luna almost always wears leg warmers to bed.

From this, we can infer that Luna is more likely to be someone who likes or needs to wear leg warmers. Leg warmers are typically worn for warmth and comfort, which makes sense in a ‚ùÑÔ∏è (cold) environment.

    encrypted_option_1: Finnegan
    encrypted_option_2: River
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step:

* The text states that Kyle doesn't wear leg warmers to bed, which implies that Kyle prefers cooler temperatures.
* It also states that Logan almost always wears leg warmers to bed, which suggests that Logan prefers warmer temperatures.

Based on this information, it is more likely that **Logan** lives in a warmer climate.
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

Finnegan ‚ùåüõãÔ∏è means that Finnegan is sleeping or in bed (‚ùå means "not" and üõãÔ∏è is a symbol for sleep).

River ‚è∞üí§ also implies that River is asleep or tired (‚è∞ can mean "time" but in this context might imply being sleepy, and üí§ is the sleep symbol).

Given these clues, it's more likely that Finnegan ‚òÄÔ∏èüî•... because Finnegan is already awake/sleeping, while River was indicated to be sleeping/tired.

    encrypted_option_1: Compass
    encrypted_option_2: Atlas
    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

The story is about navigating home, and the speaker had a way to do so using both GPS and map. Then, something happened that caused them to get lost.

So, what could have turned the "map" upside down? Ah-ha! That would be the most logical explanation!

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I think step by step, considering the context of the sentence and the meaning of each option.

The sentence is about getting lost while using a compass and atlas to navigate. The phrase "got lost when the [blank] got [up]" suggests that something changed direction or orientation, causing the person to become lost.

Compass helps with navigation by providing direction (north/south/east/west), but it doesn't change its direction. Atlas is a map book that provides information about geographic locations and routes, not physical movement.

So, I think the correct option is:

Option 2: Atlas

    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step, considering that the text mentions using both a GPS and a map to navigate home. This makes it likely that "the" refers back to one of those two things.

So, I choose Option 2: map.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A clever one! üòÑ

Let's think step by step:

üìç and üó∫Ô∏è are both symbols that can be related to navigation.

ü§ù Alex is a person who is involved in the situation.

üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è hoAlex suggests that Alex is going somewhere (home?).

So, putting it all together, I think "hoAlex" means Alex is heading home. That's where GPS (Option 1) comes in - it's a technology that helps people navigate to their destination.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence says that Patricia is "racing by overhead", which means she is above Emily. The phrase "as $was on the ramp" suggests that someone (or something) was approaching or standing at a certain point, and this action is being compared to Patricia racing by overhead.

So, it's likely that Patricia was not on the ramp, but rather something else was. This would mean that Emily was on the ramp, as she looked up and saw Patricia above her.

Therefore, I'll choose:

Answer: 1

The sentence starts with "Emily looked up and saw..." which suggests that Emily is observing something. Then it says "Patricia racing by overhead", which implies that Patricia is moving quickly in a direction above where Emily is standing.

So, when the sentence says "as was under the ramp...", it's likely referring to someone who is beneath the same structure or area as the ramp where Emily is looking up at Patricia. Given this context, I think the most logical choice would be:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence is saying that Ava looked up and saw someone doing something with their feet (üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) in an upward direction (‚¨ÜÔ∏è), as if they were ramp... 

So, it's likely that the person Ava saw was going up a ramp, which means the correct option should be "Luna". Here's my response:

    original_prompt_answer: Let me think step by step...

The sentence starts with "The treasury workers took the gold bars off of the trolley..." which means the focus is on what happened to the trolley. Then, it says "...and stacked them in the safe until the _ was empty..."

This implies that something inside the safe got emptied out. The only logical conclusion is that the safe itself got emptied out.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I need to think step by step. The sentence starts with "The treasury workers..." which means we are talking about the actions of some people who work in a treasury. Then it says "took the gold bars off of the ...". This suggests that there is something that has the gold bars, and then they took them away.

From this information, I can conclude that the blank should be filled with the second option: üöÇ. This makes sense because trains (üöÇ) often carry valuable items like gold bars, so it would make sense for the treasury workers to remove the gold from a train.

    encrypted_option_1: safe
    encrypted_option_2: trolley
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence is describing a process where treasury workers are storing gold bars somewhere. They take the gold bars from the trolley and stack them in a container until it's full. This implies that the trolley has some capacity or space to hold the gold bars initially, but it's not meant to be the final destination.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is Option 1: safe.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A clever text!

Let's break it down step by step:

* "The tina took the" - This sounds like a person or entity taking something, so I'll assume it's not a container.
* "...gold bars üöÇ and üí∞üè†" - Ah, now we have some interesting words! üöÇ is a train symbol, which suggests transportation. üí∞ is money, and üè† is a house. So, "gold bars" are likely being transported.
* "...until the üîô was full...." - üîô is an arrow pointing up, suggesting "up to" or "until". A common phrase that fits this pattern is "until the bucket was full...".

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is:

Option 2: trolley

    answer: 1

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'He': 'Ethan', 'thought': 'imagined', 'had': 'had', 'time': '45', 'to': 'to', 'the': 'the', 'store': 'üèÉ\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏èüõçÔ∏è', '_': 'üîß', 'was': 'was', 'under': 'below', 'construction': 'üöß'}

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence is "He thought he had time to take the scenic route to the store, but the ... was under construction."

The phrase "to the" indicates that we're talking about a path or way leading somewhere. The word being modified by this phrase should be an abstract noun that refers to a path.

Option 1: "route" fits perfectly! It's an abstract noun that refers to a path, and it makes sense in the context of the sentence.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence starts with "Ethan imagined he had 45 to take..." which implies that the 45 is a quantity of something. Then it says "...to the [blank]...", which suggests that the blank is a destination or an activity.

Given the context and the emojis üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüõçÔ∏è, which represent running and shopping, I think the correct completion is:

"Answer: üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüõçÔ∏è"

The sentence would then read: "Ethan imagined he had 45 to take the scenic route to the üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüõçÔ∏è, but the üîß was below üöß...."

    option1: route
    option2: store
    answer: 2

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'He': 'Henry', 'thought': 'thinks', 'the': 'to', 'time': '12:00üïó', 'scenic route': 'üå≥üí®', 'store': 'üè™', 'was': 'is', 'closed early': '‚ùåüîô'}

    encrypted_option_2: üè™
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says "He thought he had time to take the scenic route to the store..." So, we know that the scenic route is related to going to the store.

The phrase "but the [blank] was closed early" indicates a surprise or an unexpected twist. This suggests that something that He had counted on being available is no longer available.

Given these clues, I think the correct answer is:

Option 1: route

Answer: $1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the sentence, I would think step by step as follows:

Henry thinks he had 12:00üïó to take to üå≥üí® to to üè™, but to _____ is ‚ùåüîô.

Since Henry already mentioned taking time to go to the store (üè™), it doesn't make sense for him to need to go back to the store. Therefore, I would choose Option 1: route.

    encrypted_option_1: chair
    encrypted_option_2: table
    original_prompt_answer: A simple one!

She didn't want to dust the wood chair anymore, so she got a new plastic table. Therefore, the answer should be...

Answer: Table
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence starts with "Fiona remembered to dust Hannah...", which suggests that Fiona was supposed to do something for Hannah. The next part says "...so she bought a üíß instead." This implies that Fiona decided not to do the original task (dusting) and did something else (bought a üíß).

üíß is likely a cleaning product, such as a vacuum cleaner or a mop, which would be used to clean the üè†.

The sentence ends with "...Cleaning the üè† is üïí...." This implies that the action being described is still related to cleaning the house. The word "üïí" is likely an hour or time of day, indicating when the cleaning takes place.

Putting it all together, we can infer that Fiona bought a cleaning product (üíß) instead of dusting Hannah's üõãÔ∏è, and then cleaned her üè† at some point in the day (üïí).

    encrypted_option_1: chair
    encrypted_option_2: table
    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step.

The sentence starts with "She remembered how annoying it is to dust..." and then talks about buying a plastic table. This implies that the speaker was previously dealing with dusting a wood chair, which was annoying.

So, since the sentence is talking about the wood chair being time-consuming to clean, I'll fill in the blank with:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step:

* "Ruby remembered" means someone has recalled something.
* The emojis that follow are associated with the thing Ruby remembered: ü§Ø (shock/ surprise), üí™ (strength/power), and üõãÔ∏è (bed/rest).
* A üì¶ is a package/package delivery.
* A üè† is a home.

Putting it all together, Ruby likely remembered unpacking or organizing something at her home. The phrase "a __" suggests that there's an object being referred to, which fits with the idea of unpacking a package.

Given this context, I think the correct answer is:

    encrypted_option_1: unconscious
    encrypted_option_2: conscious
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step.

The text states that we need to focus on "changing the conscious actions" to overcome behavioral bias. This suggests that the text is talking about a type of action that can be controlled or changed through intention and effort.

Therefore, I will choose the option that implies voluntary control over the action. That would be:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I would think step by step as follows:

* The text is talking about overcoming habitual habits.
* It suggests that we should focus on changing our intentional intentions, not unintentional ones.
* This implies that the actions being referred to are likely the ones that are driven by our intentions.

With this understanding, I would choose Option 2: conscious. This makes sense because conscious actions are the ones that are driven by our deliberate intentions, rather than unconscious habits.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

We're trying to overcome behavioral bias, which is an automatic or habitual way of thinking or acting that can be flawed. To change this, we need to focus on something that we can control or influence.

The text states that changing the conscious actions would help, whereas unconscious actions are involuntary (meaning we can't directly control them). Therefore, the correct answer should indicate what is involuntary, which is...

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text mentions "behavioural bias" and says that to overcome it, we should focus on changing the conscious actions. This implies that the unconscious actions are not something we can actively change.

The phrase "involuntary" means that something is done without intention or control. Given this definition, I think Option 1 "unconscious" makes more sense.

Unconscious actions are indeed involuntary, whereas conscious actions involve intentional decision-making.

    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence is saying that Megan has a lot less money than Jessica, which implies that Jessica has more money. The reason for this difference in wealth is because someone just bought the winning lottery ticket. This "someone" can only be one of two people mentioned in the text: Megan or Jessica.

So, I'll choose the option that makes sense in this context. If Jessica had just bought the winning lottery ticket, it would explain why she has more money than Megan. Therefore, my answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says "Ava has a lot ______ than Zara..." which implies that we're comparing something between Ava and Zara. The phrase "______ than Zara" is indicating that the blank should be filled with something that is greater or more in quantity for Ava compared to Zara.

The rest of the sentence says "...because she won the lottery ticket." Which suggests that the comparison is about having money (üí∏).

    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I need to think step by step. The sentence is saying that Megan has a lot more money than Jessica because someone (either Megan or Jessica) just bought the winning lottery ticket. Since this event would result in Megan having more money than Jessica, it must be Megan who just bought the winning lottery ticket.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is comparing Kara and Nina, saying Kara has a lot more money. The phrase "because Emily" suggests that there's someone named Emily who has something to do with the amount of money Kara and Nina have.

Then we see üí∞üëÄ üéüÔ∏è, which are emojis for money (üí∞), eyes or attention (üëÄ), and a ticket or an event (üéüÔ∏è). Putting these together, it seems like Emily is somehow involved in showing or selling something related to the amount of money Kara and Nina have.

The sentence implies that Kara has more money than Nina because... well, because someone's showing off their wealth! It makes sense that the comparison would be based on what Emily is showing, rather than what Nina has.

    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step, considering that the speaker wants a sweeter snack, which suggests they prefer the sweet component of their snack.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text says that Evelyn was given a bag of "sweet treats" (üå∞üçû sweet üç∞). This implies that the treats are already sweet.

Then, it says that Evelyn wanted a sweeter treat, which means she wanted something even sweeter than what she had initially. This suggests that the new addition should also be sweet or add sweetness to the existing treats.

Considering this, I think Evelyn later on added raisins (Option 1) for now because raisins are naturally sweet and would complement the existing sweet treats.

    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

Samantha wants something, and she eats the ___________ for now.

The option that makes sense is:

The sentence starts with "Austin Elijah does not..." and then describes a situation where something is very neat.

Austin is already mentioned as one of the names in the text, so Derrick makes more sense.

    encrypted_option_1: Ryan
    encrypted_option_2: Trevor
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says "Derrick does not [verb] because...". This means that Derrick doesn't like to clean, and the reason is that something (or someone) is very untidy.

Craig loves to clean all the time, so it can't be Craig who is untidy. If Craig were untidy, he would likely hate cleaning!

So, we're left with Derrick being described as "very untidy". This makes sense because the sentence says Derrick doesn't like to clean (because of his untidiness).

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Ryan rethey loves to clean the the..." which implies that Ryan likes to do something. Then it says "...but Trevor not not because..." which means that there is a contrast between what Ryan does and what Trevor does.

So, we can conclude that Ryan cleans, but Trevor doesn't. The reason given is that "..._ is very untidy...". This suggests that the person who is untidy is Trevor, as it's contrasting with Ryan's tidiness.

    option1: Dennis
    option2: Robert
    answer: 1

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'Dennis': 'Ethan', 'Robert': 'Reese', 'his hammer': "Samantha's hammer", 'hammer the nails': 'üí™'}

    encrypted_sentence: Ethan gave Samantha's hammer to Reese so he could üí™. _ had plenty of hammers.
    encrypted_option_1: Ethan
    encrypted_option_2: Reese
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Dennis gave his hammer to Robert, which means Robert already has the hammer. The text also states that "he" (referring to Robert) can "hammer the nails", implying that Robert is going to use the hammer.

Therefore, since Robert already has the hammer and is going to use it, Robert would not need "plenty of hammers". This makes sense only if someone else had plenty of hammers. That someone else is Dennis!

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I will think step by step...

Ethan gave Samantha's hammer to Reese, which means that Ethan is not the one who had plenty of hammers anymore. It's probably someone who got the hammer from Ethan. The reason why Reese needed a hammer is to be able to "üí™", meaning to lift or move something heavy.

So, the answer should be:

    original_prompt_answer: A classic play on words!

I think step by step...

The sentence is describing a contrast between two events. The party was "more interesting" and "uplifting", which suggests that it had a positive atmosphere.

The word "rigid" is used to describe the opposite of what happened at the funeral. A funeral is often formal, solemn, and serious (i.e., "rigid").

Putting it all together...

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let me think step by step...

The text is talking about a situation where the author found one experience to be more joyful and uplifting, while the other experience was not. The phrase "Samantha was üëÄ" suggests that Samantha's attention or focus was on something, which influenced her emotions.

Given these clues, I'm going to choose Option 2: ‚ò†Ô∏è as the correct answer. This is because the text implies that the unpleasant experience (‚ò†Ô∏è) would not have been so bad if it weren't for Samantha's involvement or attention.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that the party was more interesting and uplifting than the ___, implying that the funeral is not interesting or uplifting.

In contrast, option 1 "party" would mean that the party itself is flexible, which doesn't make sense in this context. The correct answer should be something that contrasts with "interesting" and "uplifting".

Option 2 "funeral" fits perfectly! Funerals are often solemn and sad, so saying that the funeral was inflexible makes sense.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The text is talking about a celebration with emojis, which are typically associated with happiness. The word "was" indicates that something happened in the past.

The sentence starts with üéâ, which is a party popper emoji, suggesting a festive atmosphere. Then, we have üòä, which represents a smiling face and a positive emotional tone. Next, we have üåà, which is a rainbow emoji, often used to represent hope or something beautiful. The combination of these emojis already gives us a sense that the event was likely a happy occasion.

The phrase "and üíî" suggests that there might be some sadness or emotional complexity involved. However, this sadness is immediately followed by üïØÔ∏è and ü§î, which are often used to represent light, understanding, or insight.

Considering the overall tone of the emojis and the use of words like "flexible", I think the sentence is describing a party where Samantha was flexible in some way. Therefore, I choose:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step.

The text says that the geese prefer to nest in the fields rather than the forests. This implies that the geese are trying to avoid something, specifically predators.

It then says that in the _______________, predators are more hidden. This suggests that the geese are looking for a place where predators might be less concealed.

Comparing the options, we can see that Option 2 "forests" is more likely correct because forests typically have thicker vegetation and more hiding spots for predators, making them harder to detect.

    encrypted_option_2: üî•
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text says that the geese prefer to nest in the fields rather than the forests. This suggests that there might be some reason why the geese prefer the open spaces of the fields over the more dense and hidden areas of the forests.

According to the text, the reason is that in the ___, predators are very visible.

This implies that the presence or absence of certain factors (i.e., visibility) is what's making the difference for the geese. Since the geese prefer the open spaces of the fields, it must be that predators are more visible in the fields than in the forests.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step...

The text says that geese love building their home in a certain environment (üåæüèûÔ∏è). Then it mentions something they don't like, which is related to wild animals. Since the previous phrase was about the geese's home, the next part must be about what kind of wild animals might disturb their home or habitat.

The two options are:

Option 1: üåº (this doesn't fit with the context)
Option 2: üî• (this could refer to fire or heat, which could potentially disrupt the geese's habitat)

Based on this analysis, I'll fill in the blank...

The sentence is saying that the plant took up too much room in something (the urn), and the problem is that the thing it's taking up too much space from is small. So, if the thing it's taking up too much space from is small, then that means... the urn was small!

* "The plant took up..." - This is an action happening to the plant.
* "...in the __" - The location where this is happening.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is describing a situation where the plant is taking up too much space. This implies that the problem is with the size of something related to the plant.

Option 1 says "plant", but it doesn't make sense in this context because we're trying to explain why the plant is taking up too much room, not describe the plant itself.

Option 2 suggests "urn", which makes more sense. The sentence would be saying that the urn was large and therefore couldn't fit all of the plant's contents comfortably.

Answer: Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence says that the plant took up too much room... This implies that something is being occupied or taken up. The phrase "in the urn" suggests that the urn is the container where this taking up is happening.

So, it seems more logical to say that the Papyrus (whatever its size) is occupying the space in the urn, not the plant itself. Therefore...

    encrypted_option_1: üè†
    encrypted_option_2: ground
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "I installed a new bird house...", so we know the subject is a bird house. Then, it says "...outside above the ground...". This suggests that the bird house is not directly on the ground, but rather elevated.

The rest of the sentence mentions the cat and the phrase "too low", which implies that something was too close to the cat's reach. Putting this together, we can conclude that the "ground" is the correct answer because it's being compared to the height of the bird house, suggesting that the ground is too low for the cat.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is describing an installation, which is typically done on a surface or a level. The phrase "since the ___ was too low" suggests that something related to the installation process wasn't at the right height.

Given the options, I think Option 2: ground makes more sense. If the ground was too low, it would be reasonable to install something on top of it to raise the level.

    encrypted_option_1: üê¶
    encrypted_option_2: üí™
    original_prompt_answer: Let me think step by step...

Since the bird house is being propped up higher, it means that initially it wasn't high enough. The text mentions the cat, which implies that the cat might have been able to reach the bird house if it was closer to the ground. Therefore, the correct option is the one that refers to a distance or height from the initial position.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence is describing an action that Evelyn did to something or someone. Since it starts with "Evelyn a..." and ends with "...the...", it seems like she gave something to someone or something.

The phrase "üê¶ üå≥ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è" could be interpreted as her giving a bird (or something related to birds) a place to grow (since üå≥ means plants or trees). The rest of the sentence seems to describe an action that started after some kind of blockage or barrier was removed ("since the _ üö´").

Given these clues, I think Option 1 is the correct answer.

    original_prompt_answer: Since the sentence is saying that the speaker prefers the spa over the pool, it makes sense that they would compare the cold water aspect between the two. Therefore, I think the correct option is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "I prefer" and ends with "...not relaxing". This means that there must be a subject-verb-object structure in the middle. The options are üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and üèä, which seem to be activities.

So, I'm going to fill in the blank assuming that one of these activities is something you prefer, and the other is not relaxing. In that case, I think it's more likely that the non-relaxing activity would be the hot tub experience with ‚ùÑÔ∏èüåä (which seems like a pretty intense and possibly chaotic situation).

Therefore, I'm going to choose Option 2: üèä.

Answer: 1

The sentence is describing a preferred activity and a place where someone finds something (‚òïÔ∏è) relaxing. The context suggests that the speaker values relaxation, so it's likely that the ‚òïÔ∏è is being enjoyed in a quiet or peaceful environment.

    option1: Megan
    option2: Elena
    answer: 2

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'Megan': 'Luna', 'Elena': 'Aria', 'makeup': 'no makeup', 'liberating': 'üòå'}

    encrypted_sentence: Luna said it would be üòå to go out without no makeup like Aria does. _ never wore no makeup when she left the house.
    encrypted_option_1: Luna
    encrypted_option_2: Aria
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence says "Megan said it would be liberating to go out without makeup like Elena does." This means that Megan is talking about someone else (Elena) and admiring her for not wearing makeup.

The blank refers to what Elena never wore when she left the house. Since Megan is talking about Elena, we can infer that Elena is the one who "never wore makeup when she left the house".

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text says that Luna said something about going out without makeup, and that it would be "like Aria does". This implies that Aria is someone who doesn't wear makeup when she leaves the house.

So, the correct completion of the blank would be: "never wore no makeup when she left the house...".

    encrypted_sentence: Ruby said it would be liberating to go out without üé® like Luna does. Ava always wore üé® when she left the house.
    encrypted_option_1: Ruby
    encrypted_option_2: Luna
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence suggests that Elena is someone who doesn't wear makeup when she leaves the house, which implies that Elena is the person who sets an example for Megan to follow.

Therefore, I choose:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is talking about what Ruby and Ava wear when they leave the house. It mentions that Ruby thinks going out without something like what Luna does would be liberating, which means freeing or empowering.

Since Ruby is thinking about what Luna does, it implies that Luna doesn't wear something (in this case, üé®) when she leaves the house. So, Ava always wears üé® when she leaves the house.

Therefore, I'll choose Option 2: Luna as the correct answer.

    encrypted_option_1: Roderick
    encrypted_option_2: Lila
    original_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence suggests that Leslie's wealth is less than Donald's because of something related to her property. This implies that Leslie owns a property.

The phrase "companies had found oil on the property" indicates that the discovery of oil has increased the value or wealth of someone.

Given these clues, it's likely that Leslie is the one who owns the property where the oil was found, making her richer than Donald.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I need to think about why Roderick would be richer than Lila. Since "companies had found üíßüèóÔ∏è" (water and land or water resources) on Roderick's property, it implies that his property has valuable natural resources. Therefore, I will choose the option that makes sense in this context.

    encrypted_option_1: Roderick
    encrypted_option_2: Stheia
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Donald was poorer than Leslie because of something related to Leslie. The phrase "companies had found oil on the property" suggests that this is something good for someone, making them richer.

So, if companies had found oil on Leslie's property, it means that Leslie must be the one who owned or had control over that property. This would make sense, because being poorer than someone else implies that someone else has more wealth or resources.

Therefore, I choose Option 2: Leslie.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I'll think step by step...

The sentence is describing a comparison between Roderick and Stheia. The comparison is about something being "less than" someone else, which implies that the missing word should be Option 1.

    encrypted_sentence: Feeling a draft, Evelyn asked Ava to please close the üö™ because _ was closer.
    encrypted_option_1: Evelyn
    encrypted_option_2: Ava
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that William asked Neil to close the front door. This implies that William is already inside the house and can see that the door is open. He's asking Neil, who is probably standing outside or closer to the door, to close it.

This means Neil is physically closer to the door than William. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence is asking for something to be done to close the door (üö™), so it must be someone who can control the door's opening or closing. Since Ava is being asked to do something, that suggests Ava has the ability to control the door. Therefore, the correct answer is:

    encrypted_option_2: Julian
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that William asked Neil to do something. The "something" is "please close the front door". This means that Neil is the one doing the action (closing the door). Therefore, Neil must be farther away from the door.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence starts with "Feeling a draft..." which indicates that someone is feeling cold air coming in. Then it says "...Eva asked Julian to please close the front door because...". This implies that Eva is asking Julian to do something, and the reason for this request is because there's a draft (or cold air) coming in through the front door. So, I'll choose the option that makes sense: the one who can actually close the door.

    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence states that Lindsey loves duck, while Megan likes chicken better. Since Megan is ordering kung pao chicken, it implies that she prefers chicken over duck, which aligns with the original statement.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step:

* The text states that Ava loved something and Evelyn preferred something.
* Ava is mentioned as loving something, so it's likely that she would order this thing for dinner.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step:

* We know that Fiona loved the taste of duck, so it's unlikely that she would order the duck.
* Ava is mentioned as liking chicken better than duck, but we don't have any information about her ordering the duck or not.
* The sentence suggests that someone ordered the duck for a meal (üç¥), and since Fiona liked duck, it's possible that she could be the one who ordered it.

The sentence says "Elena would grab their inventory... because [blank] was a businessperson." This implies that Elena is grabbing the inventory on behalf of someone who is good at running a business.

That someone is Megan. The sentence suggests that Elena is doing the work for Megan, which means Megan must be the one who is the businessperson.

Answer: $2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is talking about someone grabbing a package and giving it to someone else (Aisha) to sell. The blank refers to the person who would grab the package.

The phrase "for Aisha" indicates that the action is being done for someone else's benefit, which is Aisha. This suggests that the person mentioned in the blank is not Aisha, as Aisha is already receiving something (the package).

Therefore, I choose Option 1: Sofia.

    encrypted_option_1: Raymond
    encrypted_option_2: Sofia
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Eric is teaching Neil some proper stretches. This implies that someone (Neil) is already doing these stretches and getting paid for it.

The blank is asking why Neil is using those specific stretches to get paid. It's likely because he's working as a professional, probably in the field of fitness or dance, where knowing proper stretches is important.

Given this context, I think it's more likely that Eric is teaching Neil these stretches because Neil (the person getting paid) was using them to get paid.

Answer: Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A clever text!

Let's break it down step by step:

* The sentence is about someone teaching something to someone else.
* "all of the üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" refers to a plural noun, which means it's likely a group or collection of something.
* "to Sofia" indicates that Sofia is the recipient of this teaching.
* The reason for this teaching is because Ruth is using these things to get paid. This implies that Ruth is an expert or has some kind of authority over these things.

Putting all these clues together, I think Raymond is teaching Sofia about üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (whatever those are!) because Ruth uses them to earn a living, and Raymond is helping Sofia learn about them. Therefore, the correct answer is:

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The text states that Eric is teaching Neil something. Therefore, it must be Option 2: Neil who was using the stretches to get in shape.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is saying that Samantha was teaching something to Jax. The something being taught is a group of people (üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Therefore, it must be the one using those people to do something.

According to the sentence, they are using them to üí™, which suggests some kind of strength or power. It makes more sense that Samantha would be using Jax and the others to achieve that goal, rather than the other way around.

    encrypted_option_1: Sofia

    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step... Okay! Since Patricia doesn't have as much money to spend, it means she can afford less than what Tanya can. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A simple one!

To complete the blank, I'll think step by step:

* The sentence is comparing Sofia and Maya.
* It says Sofia doesn't have what Maya has.
* What Maya has is "42 to spend" (presumably referring to money).
* So, if Sofia doesn't have 42 to spend like Maya, it means Sofia can't afford something that Maya can.

Now, I'll fill in the blank:

...like Maya a 5 bedroom house.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The text says that Patricia doesn't have as much money to spend as Tanya. This means that Patricia has less money than Tanya.

When buying a home, the person with less money (Patricia) would likely buy a smaller or more affordable house. In this case, it's described as a 1-bedroom house.

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: Patricia

    encrypted_option_1: tweezer
    encrypted_option_2: wristlet
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "I wanted to buy small tweezer..." which means the speaker is talking about the tweezer they want to buy. Then it says "...to fit in my wristlet...", which indicates that the speaker wants the tweezers to be small enough to fit inside their wristlet.

So, what's too small? It can't be the wristlet itself, because that would mean the speaker is saying their wristlet is too big! But if they want tweezers to fit inside it, then the tweezers being "too small" makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

Ava wanted to buy something to put in her charm box. A tweezer is a small tool used for plucking or cleaning, so it wouldn't fit well into a charm box. On the other hand, a wristlet is a type of charm that can be attached to a necklace or bracelet.

    original_prompt_answer: A simple one!

Let's think step by step:

* The sentence is about comparing how two people, Kevin and Nelson, handle emergencies.
* It says "Handling emergencies was never very difficult for Kevin", which implies that Kevin can handle emergencies easily.
* Then it contrasts this with Nelson, saying "it was for Nelson because [something] could remain calm under pressure."
* This means that Nelson has trouble handling emergencies because he cannot remain calm under pressure.

So, the blank should be filled with the person who CAN remain calm under pressure... which is Kevin!

    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step... Okay, so the sentence says "Handling emergencies was never very difficult for Kevin but it was for Nelson because..." Then it's contrasting Kevin with Nelson. So, what makes handling emergencies difficult for Nelson? It can't be that Kevin is able to handle them well, because that would make no sense in this context. Therefore, Nelson is the one who has trouble remaining calm under pressure...

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says "unknown person wasn't able to remain calm under pressure...". This implies that the person who can't remain calm is not one of the two main characters mentioned, Ethan or Raven. Instead, it's someone else, an "unknown person".

So, if we're talking about the difficulty of handling emergencies between Ethan and Raven, it would make sense to say that Raven has trouble remaining calm under pressure.

    encrypted_option_1: Ava

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is asking about something that "didn't" do something. This indicates that we're looking for a subject (the one who asked the question) that didn't need tampons or pads.

We know it's not Emily, because she's the one asking Sarah if she needs any. So, the blank should refer to Sarah!

Answer: $2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence starts with "Ava asked her Ruby Lila..." So, Ava is the one asking a question.

"...if she ‚ùì any üß¥ from the üèõÔ∏è..." This part is asking about something that belongs to someone. The word being sought is probably "has" or "own", which would fit with the context of asking if someone has something.

"...even though Hannah üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è because she had üíß...." This sentence seems to be explaining why Ava asked Lila, but it's not relevant to filling in the blank. The important part is that Ava is asking Lila a question, and that question starts with "if".

    encrypted_option_2: Raven
    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

The sentence starts with "Emily asked...", so we know who's asking. Then it says "her sister", which indicates that Sarah is the sister being referred to. The question is then directed at Sarah, "if she needed...".

So, since the sentence is about what Sarah didn't do, I conclude that Sarah is the one who didn't switch to using menstrual cups.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let me think step by step...

The sentence is saying that Luna asked her sister if she needed any tampons or pads from the üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí∏, but someone didn't get them because they had switched to using menstrual cups.

That "someone" is likely Raven, since Luna is asking the question. So, it's Raven who didn't get tampons/pads because she switched to using menstrual cups.

    encrypted_option_1: Ava
    encrypted_option_2: Luna
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence is describing someone who is not immune to allergies. The phrase "unlike Tanya" implies that Tanya is immune to allergies. Therefore, the blank should be filled with the person who has an allergy, which is Elena.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says "Ava had a horrendous coughing fit from the üåº, unlike Luna , since _ was üíä...." This implies that there is some kind of comparison between Ava and Luna.

The word "unlike" suggests that they have different reactions to something. The sentence mentions üåº, which could be the cause of their different reactions.

Since it's saying "Ava had a horrendous coughing fit", it means Ava reacted poorly to whatever the cause was (üåº). This implies that Luna didn't react as badly, or maybe not at all.

The phrase "since _ was üíä" suggests that there is some kind of condition or situation being described. The word "was" indicates that this condition existed in the past.

Putting it all together, I think the blank should be filled with the option that describes a person who didn't react poorly to üåº. That would be...

So, I would fill in the blank with:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I'll think step by step...

The text says that Aisha had a bad coughing fit because something is related to allergies. It also mentions Nalani, implying that Nalani has no problem with the same thing.

So, since Nalani wasn't affected, it must be something about Aisha that's connected to allergies...

We know that Sofia picked up Aisha, which means Aisha was the one being driven. Since they are carpooling together, it makes sense that Aisha would be grateful for the ride and offer some gas money to show appreciation.

The sentence starts with "Ava discreetly admitted to...", which means someone is confessing something to Ava, and that someone is likely the one who would be reassuring her.

So, I'll choose Option 2:

The sentence starts with "Ruth discreetly admitted to Ava...", so it's about what Ruth said to Ava.

Then, it says she didn't know how to something. That something is the blank that needs to be filled in.

Looking at the options, I see that Option 1 is "Ruth", which doesn't fit because Ruth is the one who is admitting or saying something. 

Option 2 is "Ava", which could fit because it's Ava that Ruth is talking to!

    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I would think step by step:

* The sentence is describing what happened at the party.
* The employees got drunk and couldn't go to work the next day.
* Therefore, the focus of the sentence is on the noise level of the party.

With this in mind, I believe the correct answer is:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

The sentence says "The team held... and imbibed..." which implies that the team is doing something together, and then they're drinking something. The word "imbibed" means to drink or take in a liquid.

So, considering the context and the verb "imbibed", I think the blank should be filled with an option that refers to an event or activity where people come together to have fun, eat, and drink. That's why I choose...

    encrypted_option_1: üíÉ
    encrypted_option_2: üçπ
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "The employees threw a party..." which tells us that the focus is on the party, so it can't be option 2 (alcohol).

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I'll think step by step!

The sentence starts with "The employees threw a..." which suggests that the employees had some kind of celebration or party, and what they threw is likely the focus of the sentence.

Then it says "...and drank so much...", which implies that there was also drinking involved in this event. This tells me that option 1 (üíÉ) can't be the correct answer, as throwing doesn't fit with the idea of drinking.

So, considering the sentence further, I think what they threw is likely a "party" or some kind of celebration, which would mean that option 2 (üçπ) makes more sense. The phrase "copious intoxication" suggests that the employees got very drunk, which fits well with the idea of drinking.

Therefore, my answer is:

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is saying that Dennis enjoyed the trip more than Jason. The reason for this difference in enjoyment is given as "had a shallow understanding of the Polish language". This implies that Jason, not Dennis, has a shallow understanding of the Polish language.

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A classic lateral thinking puzzle!

Let's think step by step:

* The text says "Once in üáµüá±, Rafael enjoyed the trip more than Sofia..."
* This means that we're comparing Rafael and Sofia's experiences at some place.
* ...because [something] had a ü§î (a puzzled face).
* So, what could have happened that would make Rafael enjoy his trip more?

Hmm... what if something went wrong for Sofia? Maybe she got lost or missed her luggage. That would certainly puzzle her!

    encrypted_option_1: Kantanrzynan
    encrypted_option_2: Manteusz
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence says that "Dennis enjoyed the trip more than Jason" implies that we are comparing their experiences. Then it says "because [someone] had a deeper understanding of the Polish language..."

This suggests that Dennis' enjoyment was due to his own understanding of the Polish language, which is deeper than Jason's.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is talking about someone who had a better trip than another person because they have a deeper understanding of the language. The phrase "Once in üáµüá±" suggests that the trip was taken in Poland.

So, the subject of the sentence is the one who enjoyed the trip more, which is either Kantanrzynan or Manteusz.

Since "possesses an more profound understannding of of üáµüá± lannguange" indicates that this person has a deeper understanding of the Polish language, it's likely that they are the one taking the trip in Poland. Therefore, I think the correct option is:

Option 2: Manteusz

    encrypted_option_1: Benjamin
    encrypted_option_2: Joseph
    original_prompt_answer: A simple one!

Let's think step by step:

* The sentence is about a house that someone designed (Benjamin) for someone else (Joseph).
* This house is "beautiful", which suggests that it's notable or impressive in some way.
* As a result, the owner of this house (Joseph) decides to use this design as an example of his work ("in his portfolio").

So, who would use their own beautiful house design in their portfolio? That wouldn't be very convincing! It's more likely that someone else (Benjamin) would showcase Joseph's design.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step.

The sentence states that the house (üè†) designed by Benjamin was pleasing to someone. That someone is likely Joseph, since the sentence mentions "Joseph" and it's not uncommon for a person to design something specifically for another person.

Given this information, the correct option is Option 2: Joseph.

The sentence says that Joseph designed a house for Benjamin. So, Joseph is the one who designed the house.

So, I'll choose Option 2: Joseph.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step. The text mentions someone named "Benjamin Julian Joseph", and we are told that the person is describing themselves as "beautiful". This implies that the person is talking about their own name, not something they use in someone else's portfolio.

    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence should make sense and describe a situation where Sue's attempt to practice meditation is thwarted.

Since Sue went to the gym with her class, it's likely that she was trying to meditate in the context of a group setting or a class activity. This means that the text should indicate that something at the gym is too busy for Sue to meditate.

Given these considerations, I think Option 2: gym is the correct answer. The sentence would read: "Sue wanted to practice meditation so she went to the gym with her class but the gym was too busy..."

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

Ava wanted to practice something, which is indicated by the üôè emoji. This suggests that Ava is engaging in an activity or a skill.

The üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è emoji represents a gym or fitness setting, where people typically go to exercise or work out.

Since Ava went to the üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è with her üìö (book), it's likely that she's using some sort of educational material or notes while practicing whatever activity she's doing.

Putting all this together, I think it's more likely that the book is what Ava wants to practice, rather than the gym itself. So, the correct answer is:

Sue wanted to practice meditation, so she went to... (wait for it)... a place where you can meditate! And then it says "...with her class", which means the "class" in this sentence is probably not referring to Sue's class of students, but rather a group or session. So, the blank should be filled with an option that fits this context.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let me think step by step...

Ava went to the place with her... (so it's not Option 2, which is the place itself)

She wanted to practice meditation, so it must be a place where she can meditate... (team doesn't sound like a suitable location for meditation)

We know that Natalie thinks emeralds are beautiful, and Betty doesn't share the same opinion.

The sentence says that someone "bought a necklace featuring a big diamond...", which means the person buying the necklace is not the one who likes emeralds (Natalie).

So, it must be Betty! She's the one who bought the necklace.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I need to consider the information given in the text. It states that Ava thinks üíé (diamonds) are üë∏ (beautiful), but Sophia does not. This implies that Ava has a positive opinion of diamonds.

The sentence " _ bought a necklace featuring a big üíé" suggests that someone is acquiring a piece of jewelry with a large diamond. Given Ava's positive opinion of diamonds, it would be more likely for her to buy such a necklace than Sophia, who does not share Ava's admiration for diamonds.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

We know that Natalie thinks emeralds are beautiful, and we also know that Betty doesn't share the same opinion.

So, the sentence should describe someone who shares Natalie's positive view of emeralds. This means it can only be one person: Natalie.

    encrypted_sentence: Kai hung his üèπÔ∏è over the üî• after the üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ended up with Benjamin making the üíÄ.  Lila was happy for him.
    encrypted_option_1: Kai
    encrypted_option_2: Benjamin
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence states that Benjamin made the fatal shot, and Aaron is the one who hung his hunting rifle over the hearth after the trip ended with Benjamin making the fatal shot. This implies that Aaron was the hunter who went on the trip.

Given this context, it makes more sense for Aaron to be happy about someone else (Benjamin) making a successful shot, rather than Benjamin being happy about his own success.

Therefore, I choose:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Kai hung his üèπÔ∏è over the üî•, so it's likely referring to a specific activity or event involving Kai.

Next, it mentions the üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (runner) ended up with Benjamin making the üíÄ (death). This suggests that Benjamin was somehow involved in an outcome or consequence related to running.

Given these clues, I think it's more likely that Benjamin is the one being referred to as happy for Kai. It makes sense that Benjamin would be pleased if he had some sort of connection to Kai's achievement, which is hinted at by the fact that Benjamin ended up with something (the üíÄ) after the running event.

So, my answer is:

    encrypted_option_1: Ethan
    encrypted_option_2: Lila
    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

The sentence says "Aaron hung his hunting rifle..." which implies that Aaron is the one who went on a trip and got back from it.

Then, it mentions "Benjamin making the fatal shot." This suggests that Benjamin was the one who actually did the shooting, not Aaron. If Aaron had done the shooting, there wouldn't be a need to say "fatal shot" because it would imply that he intentionally took someone's life.

So, if Benjamin did the shooting and it was a hunting trip where people take turns making shots, then it makes sense for Benjamin to be happy about himself...

Answer: $2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step:

* The sentence talks about Ethan hanging something over a fire.

    encrypted_sentence: Liam is far more physically versatile than Ethan, because Ava is an üõèÔ∏èü§ï.
    encrypted_option_1: Liam
    encrypted_option_2: Ethan
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Kevin is "far more physically versatile" than someone else. This means that the someone else is not as physically versatile.

The reason for this difference in physical versatility is given as "because _ is an injured athlete in bed". This implies that the person being compared to Kevin is unable to move around or exercise because of their injury, which makes them less physically versatile.

So, if it's an injured athlete in bed, it must be Nick who is injured and unable to move around. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step.

The text says "Liam is far more physically versatile than Ethan..." so we know that Liam and Ethan are the two options being compared.

"...because Ava is an [blank]..."

So, Ava must be someone who is somehow related to both Liam and Ethan. The only way this makes sense is if Ava is a mutual friend or acquaintance of both Liam's and Ethan's.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option 1: Liam - This doesn't make sense because we know that Liam is being compared to Ethan, so he can't be Ava.
Option 2: Ethan - This also doesn't make sense because we already know that Ethan is being compared to Liam, so Ethan can't be Ava.

So, what's left? We need someone who is a friend or acquaintance of both Liam's and Ethan's. That would be Ava.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

    encrypted_option_1: Felix
    encrypted_option_2: Roderick
    original_prompt_answer: Let's analyze the sentence step by step. The sentence starts with "Kevin is far more physically versatile than Nick..." This indicates that we are comparing Kevin and Nick's physical versatility.

The blank is filled because "...because [something] is a seasoned athlete in training...". This phrase suggests that whoever fills the blank is an experienced athlete who is still improving their skills, which contrasts with Nick. Therefore, it makes sense to fill the blank with someone who is indeed a seasoned athlete in training.

As a result, I choose Option 2: Nick.
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence seems to be describing characteristics or qualities of people.

Felix is üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí™ Roderick, which means Felix has a similar quality or trait as Roderick.

The next part describes Luna: ü§î Luna üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüìä.... This suggests that Luna is thoughtful and perhaps analytical, and also good at running (üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and/or organized (üìä).

Putting this together, I think Felix is likely being described as strong or athletic (üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí™), like Roderick. Therefore:

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step:

* The sentence is describing a situation where someone did something lazily.
* This "lazy" action is associated with Aaron, who washed clothes by hand.
* Therefore, the person being described as lazy must be Aaron.

So, I choose Option 2: Aaron.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Ethan put üõçÔ∏è in the üíß", which means Ethan put something (üõçÔ∏è) into water (üíß). Then, "Rafael washed them ü§ö as _ was lazy...", which implies that Rafael did something to those items because someone else was lazy.

So, who was supposed to do what? If someone is lazy and didn't want to wash the items, it would make sense for Rafael to wash them instead. This implies that Ethan is the one who was lazy, not Rafael!

    encrypted_option_1: Ethan
    encrypted_option_2: Sofia
    original_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is talking about Aaron washing clothes by hand, which means he did not use a machine like the washer. The reason given for this is that "was" (implying a state of being) was conscientious.

So, since Adam put the clothes in the washer, and Aaron washed them by hand because he was conscientious, it makes sense that the blank would be filled with "Aaron".

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Ethan put handwash only handwash in the..." which indicates that Ethan is performing an action. Then it says "but Sofia washed them...", which means that there was a contrast between what Ethan did and what Sofia did.

So, since Sofia washed the handwash, she must have been using water to wash them. The sentence also mentions üåä (water) earlier, so we can conclude that Sofia used water to wash the handwash.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option 1: Ethan
Option 2: Sofia

Since it was Sofia who washed the handwash with water, the correct answer is Option 2: Sofia.

* The sentence is talking about someone who loves something (plum season), so it must be Matthew.
* We know that Matthew likes plums better, which suggests that he might be the one eagerly waiting for plum season.

So, I'll choose Option 2: Matthew.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A nice sentence completion question!

Let's think step by step:

* The text says Rosa loves something, so it must be about her.
* Then, it mentions Santiago likes something else better, which is a contrast to Rosa's preference.
* Finally, Evelyn is introduced as someone who can't wait for plum season, which implies that plums are the fruit being referred to.

The sentence states that Kyle loves the flavor of apricots, and Matthew likes plums better. This suggests that apricots are preferred by one person (Kyle), while plums are preferred by another person (Matthew).

Since "apricot season" refers to a time when apricots are available or in season, it's likely that Kyle is the one who couldn't wait for that season.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step:

The text states that "Ethan loves the flavor of üçä", which means Ethan has a preference for orange.
It also says "Matthew likes üçë better", which means Matthew has a preference for peach.
Finally, it mentions Ava couldn't wait for apricot season, implying she prefers apricots.

* This is compared to Justin, who was able to stay focused at work.
* The reason for this difference is given as "had a fun job".
* So, the blank should be filled with the person whose job is described as "fun".

Answer: $2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step! The sentence says "unlike Ethan", which means that Ethan is the opposite of what Kaitlyn is. In this case, Kaitlyn is unmotivated, so Ethan must be motivated.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence suggests that Justin is able to stay focused at work, but Derrick is not. The reason for this difference is that Derrick has a "boring" job.

This implies that the job itself is the cause of Derrick's inability to focus, rather than some personal characteristic or trait of Derrick's. Therefore, it makes sense that Justin would have a different job (one that is more engaging or interesting) that allows him to stay focused.

Answer: Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Ethan was unable to stay focused at work unlike...", which means we need to find something that contrasts Ethan's behavior. The phrase "unlike Aiden" suggests that Aiden is the one who can stay focused.

So, what has a sleep symbol üò¥? That would be the thing that Aiden has, making him different from Ethan.

Since German is a more modern language compared to Latin, which dates back to ancient times, I will choose Option 2 as the correct answer.

Answer: $2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A classic lateral thinking puzzle!

Let's think step by step:

* The text says "Rosa was debating on taking up Latin instead of Latin..."
* This implies that there are two options for Rosa to choose from.
* One of these options is mentioned in the sentence: Latin.
* Therefore, the other option must be... Latin (again)!

    encrypted_option_2: üá©üá™
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text says Avery is debating between two options, German and Latin. The phrase "the __ was old" implies that one of those options is considered old.

Since Avery is debating on taking up German instead of Latin because the language is old, it must be Latin that is old. Therefore, I'll fill in the blank with Option 1: Latin.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A fun one!

Let's think step by step...

* Finnley is debating (thinking about) taking something up.
* The options are üí° (light bulb) and üá©üá™ (Germany flag).
* So, the thing Finnley is considering taking up can't be a country or a flag.
* That leaves us with... üí°!

    encrypted_option_1: Kayla
    encrypted_option_2: Betty
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text states that Kayla dated many more people at once than Betty. This implies that there is a comparison being made between the two individuals.

The sentence also mentions that "was in an open relationship", which suggests that one of the individuals has a different type of relationship arrangement compared to the other.

Given these clues, we can infer that Option 2: Betty is the correct answer. The text implies that Betty has a more traditional or monogamous relationship setup, whereas Kayla is able to date multiple people simultaneously because she is in an open relationship.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step.

The sentence is talking about two people, Kayla and Betty. The blank refers to the person who was already in a situation that allowed them to date multiple people at once.

According to the text, it's Kayla who dated many more people than Betty, so Kayla must be the one who was already in an open relationship.

    encrypted_sentence: Kayla dated many more people at once than Betty, because _ was in an exclusive relationship.
    encrypted_option_1: Kayla
    encrypted_option_2: Betty
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Kayla dated many more people at once than Betty. This means that Betty did not date as many people simultaneously.

The phrase "than Betty" implies a comparison between Kayla and Betty. Since Betty didn't date many people, it suggests that there was someone or something that prevented her from doing so.

The blank is completed with the person or thing that was in an exclusive relationship with Betty. This means that Betty was already committed to someone else, which explains why she didn't date multiple people at once.

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: Betty
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence says that Kayla dated many more people at once than Betty. This means that Betty did not date as many people at the same time as Kayla.

The reason for this difference is because someone was in an exclusive relationship, which means they were only dating one person and not multiple people like Kayla.

So, it must be Betty who was in an exclusive relationship.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Steven showed Michael something, which is the mangoes he grew himself all this summer. This implies that Steven is the one who worked hard to grow those mangoes.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I think step by step... 

The sentence says Steven showed something to Michael, and that something is "the mangoes he grew himself all this summer". This means the subject of the verb "grew" is likely Steven, because it's his mangoes.

So, I conclude that Steven is the one who did the hard work to grow those mangoes.

    encrypted_option_1: Steven
    encrypted_option_2: michael
    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

Steven is showing Michael something, so Michael is likely surprised by what Steven is showing him.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step.

The sentence starts with "Steven proudly showed Michael...". This tells me that Steven is performing an action (showing) and he's showing something to someone named Michael. The sentence then mentions a citrus fruit üçä and sunshine üåû. So, it seems that the thing Steven is showing is related to these.

The phrase "_ is astonished" suggests that someone is surprised or amazed. Since the context is about showing something, I think this person is probably the one being shown something (Michael).

Therefore, I'll choose Option 2: michael

The sentence states that "The letter that Joel has written is being read by Adam..." This implies that the letter belongs to Joel and someone else (Adam) is reading it.

The question asks who the editor is, which means the person responsible for publishing or editing the content. In this case, since Adam is reading the letter, it makes sense that he would be the one editing it.

Answer: 2

* The letter is being read by Cameron.
* Therefore, Ryan is not reading his own letter (that would be silly!).

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Kyle was more comfortable speaking in front of large groups than Nick, which implies that something made a comparison between Kyle and Nick. The blank is filled with the subject who had taken public speaking courses in college.

Since the sentence compares Kyle and Nick, it must be talking about Nick's situation. Therefore, the correct answer should be "Nick".

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

The sentence is "Finn was more comfortable speaking in front of large groups than Gwen, because [blank] had taken [blank] in [blank]."

Since the blank refers to someone who has an effect on something else (taking something), I think it must be talking about Finn himself. The text says Finn was more comfortable speaking in front of large groups, so it's likely that something related to Finn is being talked about.

The options are Option 1: Finn and Option 2: Gwen. Since the sentence refers to someone who has taken something in school, I think it must be talking about Finn, which means he took something in school. This makes sense because it says "than Gwen", indicating a comparison between Finn and Gwen, so it's likely that something related to Finn is being talked about.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence is saying that Kyle was more comfortable speaking in front of large groups because something about Nick made him unable to take public speaking courses. The blank is describing what happened with Nick.

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: Nick
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Finn is more comfortable speaking in front of large groups "because Ava was not able to take [something] in college." This implies that there is some connection between Ava, college, and the activity or thing being taken.

Option 2: Sawyer seems unrelated to the sentence. It's unlikely that the sentence is comparing Finn's comfort level with Sawyer's comfort level because of something about Ava in college.

    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text says that Ruth swam in the "jumpsuit" (üëô), which implies she wore something covering her body while swimming.

Natalie, on the other hand, opted for a "dress" (üëñ), which is also clothing that covers the body.

So, if one of them was hesitant to show their body, it's likely not Ruth because she swam in a jumpsuit. It's more likely Natalie, who chose to wear a dress instead of something revealing like a swimsuit.

    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I will think step by step.

The sentence mentions that Ava is swimming in something, so it must be referring to her swimming attire or equipment. The sentence also mentions a dance-related word üíÉ, which could be related to a swimsuit or bathing costume.

Given these clues, I believe the correct answer is Felicia. Here's why: if Felicia opted for a üëô (which means she chose not to swim), it would make sense that Ava swam in her üíÉ (swimsuit).

The sentence is describing an impact, where something (Lily Ava's) is affected by another thing (the book hitting it). The phrase "smashed when the [option] hit it" suggests that the first option was the cause of the impact. Since the text mentions a clock (üï∞Ô∏è), I think the correct answer is:

    encrypted_option_1: üï∞Ô∏è
    encrypted_option_2: üìñ
    original_prompt_answer: Let me think this through...

The sentence is saying that something happened to Sarah Jane's watch, and it was caused by a book hitting it. This implies that the "it" in the sentence refers back to the watch.

So, the blank should be filled with the option that describes the object that is too weak... which is the watch!

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A fun one!

Let's break it down step by step:

* "Maya Singh's" is a possessive phrase, so it refers to something that belongs to Maya Singh.
* The next word is "smashed", which suggests an action of destruction or breaking. This action likely happened because of some external force.
* "when the [X] it since the [Y] was too weak" implies that there was a specific event or situation that led to the smashing, and this event was caused by the weakness of something.

Now, thinking step by step:

* The event that led to the smashing is likely related to time (üï∞Ô∏è) rather than an object or book (üìñ). Otherwise, the sentence wouldn't make sense.
* Therefore, I think the blank should be filled with üï∞Ô∏è.

    option1: Joseph
    option2: Kevin
    answer: 1

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'Joseph': 'Ethan', 'well manicured nails': 'üíÖ', 'work': 'üíº', 'Kevin': 'Kai', 'bank': 'üè¶'}

    encrypted_sentence: Ethan had to have üíÖ for üíº, but not Kai, because _ üíºed at a üè¶.
    encrypted_option_1: Ethan
    encrypted_option_2: Kai
    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step means considering the context and the given information. In this case, it says "Joseph had to have well manicured nails for work", which implies that Joseph works in an industry where appearance is important, possibly a service-oriented job or one that involves interacting with people. On the other hand, Kevin doesn't need to have well-manicured nails.

The sentence then states "because [someone] worked at a bank". This suggests that someone who works at a bank can get away with having less concern for their appearance, implying that banking is an industry where appearance isn't as crucial.

Putting these together, it's likely that Joseph (not Kevin) works at the bank. Therefore:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I need to think step by step. The sentence says that Ethan had to have "üíÖ" (which is likely manicure) for his job ("üíº"), but not Kai because Kai worked at a bank ("üè¶").

This means that Ethan works in an industry where having a good appearance is important, such as show business or sales, and therefore he needs to take care of his nails. On the other hand, banking is an industry where appearance doesn't matter as much, so Kai doesn't need to worry about it.

Therefore, I'm going to choose Option 2: Kai.

    encrypted_option_1: Julian
    encrypted_option_2: Kai
    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

Since Joseph has to have well-manicured nails for work, it means he works in an industry where appearance matters. Farms are typically outdoors and hands-on, which doesn't require formal nail care.

So, the answer is: Option 2: Kevin

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I'll think step by step...

The text says that Julian has to have well-manicured nails for work, which implies that Julian works in an industry where appearance is important. On the other hand, it doesn't matter for Kai because Kai doesn't work at a farm (üåæ). Therefore, I can conclude that:

    encrypted_option_1: Dennis
    encrypted_option_2: Natalie
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence says "Dennis fell in the mud...", so we know Dennis is the one who fell.

But then it says "Christopher kept their balance...", which implies that Christopher didn't fall. This means Christopher must be the one with spiked shoes, because if they had fallen, there would be no need to mention that they kept their balance!

So, the correct answer is...

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says "While out playing ‚õ≥Ô∏è, Dennis fell in the üåø..." This means that Dennis was playing golf and accidentally fell into a bush (üåø). Then it says "but Natalie kept their üîÅ because _ had spiked shoes on..."

Since Dennis is already described as falling, it's unlikely that he would have spiked shoes. Spiked shoes are usually associated with sports like basketball or tennis.

So, the most likely candidate for having spiked shoes is Natalie! Therefore:

    encrypted_option_1: Ethan
    encrypted_option_2: Ava
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence is saying that while Dennis and Christopher were both playing golf, Dennis fell in the mud. This implies that something about Dennis's situation caused him to fall.

The reason for Dennis's fall is because he had "slippery shoes on", which suggests that his shoes were a factor in his fall. Therefore, it was Dennis who had slippery shoes on.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence starts with "While out playing golf", which means that the people involved are the ones playing golf. Then, it says "Ethan fell in the mud", which implies that Ethan is one of the golf players.

Next, it mentions that Ava kept their balance, which means Ava is also a golf player.

Finally, it says Sarah had something on... which means Sarah is not a golf player (since she's not playing). And what does Sarah have? The sentence ends with "...because Sarah had üåø on...", where üåø is likely grass or a green surface. This makes sense because Sarah probably has some kind of lawn or garden, and the phrase "on" implies that the üåø is on something.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is:

Option 2: Ava

    encrypted_sentence: I couldn't control the moisture like I controlled the rain, because the _ was coming in at one spot.
    encrypted_option_1: moisture
    encrypted_option_2: rain
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is saying that the speaker couldn't control the moisture (rain) as easily as they normally do. The phrase "like I controlled" suggests a comparison to how they usually manage the rain. The blank refers to something that is interfering with their ability to control the moisture.

Given this context, it's more likely that the thing coming in at one spot is related to the concept of moisture rather than rain. Therefore, I'm going to choose Option 1: moisture.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, we need to think step by step. The sentence is saying that the speaker's usual control over the rain (i.e., controlling it) is different from their control over something else, which is lacking.

The sentence mentions "coming in at one spot", which implies that the issue is with something entering or flowing into a specific area. This suggests that the thing being referred to is probably liquid or semi-liquid, like moisture.

So, since the speaker's usual control is over rain (which is also a type of precipitation), it makes sense that the thing they're trying to control in this sentence would be a different form of water or moisture. Therefore, I choose:

    encrypted_option_1: 34%
    encrypted_option_2: rain
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "I couldn't control the moisture...", which means that the focus is on controlling something related to moisture. The phrase "like I controlled the rain" suggests that there was a comparison being made between controlling moisture and controlling rain.

The word "rain" implies a sense of predictability or controllability, whereas "moisture" might be more challenging to control. This makes me think that the speaker is having trouble with something related to moisture entering or affecting something.

With this in mind, I'll choose Option 1: moisture.

Answer: $1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Ava wasn't control..." which seems to be incomplete. The next part is "...34% similar Ava controlled rain, because...". This suggests that Ava was controlling something related to rain, and the similarity is 34%.

The phrase "was coming in everywhere" implies that some kind of situation or condition was occurring all around.

Putting it together, I think the blank should be filled with Option 2: rain. The sentence would make sense as:

"Ava wasn't control... 34% similar Ava controlled rain, because rain was coming in everywhere..."

    encrypted_option_1: Tanya
    encrypted_option_2: Eduardo
    original_prompt_answer: The correct answer is Option 1: Leslie. The text states that "Leslie was fascinated with collecting new shoes compared to Derrick", indicating that it's Leslie who loves fashion trends.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is "Tanya was fascinated with collecting new shoes compared to Eduardo, because Amanda loved ...". This means that Amanda's love for something is being used as a contrast to why Tanya is fascinated with collecting shoes.

The correct answer should be the one that shows a difference between what Amanda loves and what Tanya collects. Since Tanya collects shoes, Amanda must love something else.

Comparing options 1 and 2:

Option 1: Tanya - This doesn't make sense because it's saying that Amanda loves something similar to what Tanya collects (shoes). We need a contrast!

Option 2: Eduardo - This makes sense! It's saying that Amanda loves something different from what Eduardo (who is being compared to) and Tanya both collect.

    encrypted_option_1: Aisha

Since the sentence says "compared to Derrick", it implies that Derrick is not the one hating fashion trends, but rather someone else (who is being compared to Derrick). The blank refers to this person.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Since Aisha is the one who's fascinated with collecting new shoes, we're looking for a trait that describes Tyson. The sentence mentions "compared to" which implies some kind of contrast between Aisha and Tyson.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step:

* We know that Jessica thought Sandstorm was the greatest song ever written.
* This means she likes the song, so she would not buy a ticket to the jazz concert because it's not her preferred genre (rock).
* On the other hand, we know that Patricia hated Sandstorm. This means she doesn't like the rock song and might prefer a different genre, like jazz.
* Given these facts, if someone bought a ticket to the jazz concert, it would most likely be Patricia.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Ava thought", which means Ava is the one who had an opinion about something.

Then, it says "was the üî•üìÄ", which means that whatever Ava thought of was hot (like a bestseller) and a record (like a song or album).

Next, it mentions Sofia, saying she hated it. This implies that Sofia didn't like what Ava liked.

Finally, it jumps to Ethan, who is described as having done some kind of action üéüÔ∏èüï∫. The context suggests that this action is related to the thing Ava liked and Sofia disliked.

Putting all these clues together, I think Ethan must have been doing something similar to what Ava liked, but probably not exactly the same as Sofia hated it. Therefore, I'm going to choose Option 1:

    encrypted_option_1: Ava
    encrypted_option_2: Evelyn
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

We know that Jessica loves Sandstorm, so she would not buy a ticket to the Darude rave (since she already thinks it's the greatest song ever written).

On the other hand, Patricia hates Sandstorm, but we're told that someone bought a ticket to the Darude rave. This means that Patricia is the one who might have bought a ticket.

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Alex". Since the verb is "üí∞", which means to spend or give, it must be referring to something that Alex has a financial stake in. The phrase "a üéü" suggests that Alex has invested in a show or performance, and the emoji sequence üîä üíÉ implies music and dancing.

Given this context, it's likely that the sentence is describing a musical or concert, which fits with Ava thinking that üéµ (a song) is the greatest ever written. This also matches Evelyn's dislike of the same song.

    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is describing a situation where Steve put all the crackers from the bowl into something, and that something became full. The word "full" is an adjective describing the state of being filled.

Given this context, it makes more sense for the phrase to be describing the state of Steve's mouth (since he poured the crackers into his mouth), rather than the bowl itself (which would mean the bowl was still empty).

    sentences: Ben played soccer and bowling every week. However, it was easy for him to play in the _ game because he hurt his arm.
    option1: bowling
    option2: soccer
    answer: 2

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'Ben': 'played soccer:‚öΩÔ∏è and bowling:üé≥ every week:', 'However': 'üòä'}

    encrypted_sentence: played soccer:‚öΩÔ∏è and bowling:üé≥ every week: played soccer and bowling every week. üòä, it was easy for him to play in the _ game because he hurt his arm.
    encrypted_option_1: bowling
    encrypted_option_2: soccer
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text says "it was easy for him to play in the _ game". This implies that Ben is talking about a specific type of game. The sentence also mentions that Ben hurt his arm, which suggests that the activity he's playing is likely not bowling (since he can still bowl with an injured arm).

Given these clues, I think it's more likely that the game being referred to is soccer, since hurting one's arm would make it more difficult to participate in a physical activity like soccer.

Answer: 2

    encrypted_option_1: bowling
    encrypted_option_2: soccer
    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I need to think step by step about what kind of game would be affected if someone hurt their arm.

Ben played both soccer and bowling every week. The text says it was difficult for him to play in "the" game because he hurt his arm. This implies that there is only one specific game being referred to, and that game is the one where having an injured arm makes it hard to participate.

Given these conditions, I would choose Option 2: soccer.
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break down the text step by step:

* Eva played soccer and bowling.
* It was difficult for him (Eva) to play in the other sport because he hurt his arm.

Since it says "other sport", that means it can't be either soccer or bowling, as those are the two sports Eva plays. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that Eva didn't mention playing, which is:

    encrypted_option_1: Raj
    encrypted_option_2: Luna
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Nick had a bigger dog than Craig...", which means we're comparing the size of Nick's dog to Craig's. The clause "because __ fed their dog much more food" suggests that the reason for Nick's dog being bigger is that someone (either Nick or Craig) was feeding it more.

Since we know that "Nick had a bigger dog", this implies that whoever was feeding more food was... Craig! Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence starts with "Raj had a..." so we know the subject is Raj and the verb is "had". The next words are üî•, which likely indicate something exciting or special. Then comes üêï, which represents a dog (likely Luna). üìä could be a symbol for a book or document, but it doesn't fit well in this context.

Next, we have Jenny, who seems to be the one doing something with Raj's pet. The symbols üíß, ü§ù, and üêï might represent a connection between Jenny and the dog. Finally, üí™ could indicate strength or power, and ‚û°Ô∏è might imply movement or action towards something. üçî is likely a reference to food.

Considering all these clues, I think Jenny is doing something with Raj's pet (Luna) that involves strength, movement, and possibly food. This makes sense because Luna was mentioned earlier as the dog.

    sentences: Nick had a smaller dog than Craig because _ fed their dog much more food.
    option1: Nick
    option2: Craig
    answer: 2

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'Nick': 'Oliver', 'Craig': 'Evelyn', 'dog': 'üê∂'}

    encrypted_sentence: Oliver had a smaller üê∂ than Evelyn because _ fed their üê∂ much more food.
    encrypted_option_1: Oliver
    encrypted_option_2: Evelyn
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step:

The sentence states that Nick had a smaller dog than Craig. This means that Craig's dog is likely larger or at least as large as Nick's dog.

The reason for this difference in size is that one of them "fed their dog much more food." If we assume that the dog that received more food is also larger, then it must be Craig's dog that received more food, since Nick's dog is smaller.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is saying that Oliver had a smaller dog compared to Evelyn. To determine who fed the dogs more food, we need to analyze the sentence structure and context.

The phrase "had a smaller" indicates a comparison between Oliver's dog and Evelyn's dog. This implies that Oliver's dog is being described as less desirable or less healthy in some way.

Since the sentence is comparing the size of their dogs, it makes sense that one person might be feeding their dog more food to make it larger than the other dog.

Given these clues, I think Option 2: Evelyn is the correct answer. The sentence implies that Evelyn fed her dog (the larger one) more food than Oliver fed his dog (the smaller one).

    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step:

The sentence is comparing the amount of shade between two yards. It says that there's more shade in one yard (Christine) than in the other yard (Victoria). This means that Christine's yard must have a lot of plants that are blocking sunlight.

Since the question asks which one had more plants, I can conclude that it was Christine who had more plants. Therefore:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step:

* The sentence is comparing two places (Ava's and Ruby's) based on some condition (‚ùÑÔ∏è).
* The sentence states that there was more ‚ùÑÔ∏è in one place than in the other.
* Therefore, it must be Option 2: Ruby because Ava's has less ‚ùÑÔ∏è.

    encrypted_option_1: Sarah
    encrypted_option_2: Natalie
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step:

The sentence says that Christine's yard has "more" shade, which means Victoria's yard must have LESS shade. The reason for this is that Christine's yard has fewer plants than Victoria's yard.

So, the correct answer is the one that indicates a lesser number of plants, which is Option 2: Victoria

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is saying that there was more sunshine (‚òÄÔ∏è) in Sarah's garden than in Natalie's garden. It's comparing two gardens, so we need to identify the thing that makes one garden have less plants.

Sarah and Natalie are both people, not things that can be related to having plants or sunlight. So, it must be talking about one of their gardens.

The correct answer is the one that had fewer plants, which would make Sarah's garden have more sunshine (‚òÄÔ∏è) by comparison.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

We know that Kyle loves chocolate and candy, which are sweet things. We also know that Steven loves pickles and lemons, which are sour things.

So, the person who loves sour foods is... not Kyle! It must be Steven!

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

We know that Ava loves chocolate (üç´) and presents (üéÅ). This means she must be the one who loves something sweet and something celebratory.

On the other hand, Ethan loves cucumbers (ü•í) and oranges (üçã), which are both savory and healthy. This suggests that Ethan might love something playful or mischievous.

Given these clues, it's likely that Nina loves something related to laughter or joy, since she's the one left out of the equation so far.

Putting all this together, I think Nina loves üòù (which represents smiling or laughing).

    encrypted_option_1: Kyle

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

Kyle loves chocolate and candy, which are both sweet foods. This suggests that Kyle has a preference for sweet things.

Steven loves pickles and lemons, which are sour or tangy rather than sweet.

So, it's likely that "Kyle" is the one who loves sweet foods.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

We know that:

* Kyle loves something sweet
* Julian loves pickles and lemons, which are sour

Ruby is described as loving something that is the opposite of what Julian loves. Since Julian loves sour things (pickles and lemons), Ruby likely loves something sweet.

The sentence says "Since Evan ate more than Austin..." This implies that Evan has a certain quantity or amount of something (the üç∞üç´ ‚è±Ô∏è), and Austin has less.

Then the sentence says "_ had üí™" which means someone is describing as having strength or power (üí™).

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Benjamin ate unhealthy desserts far more frequently than Brett. This implies that Benjamin eats a lot of these desserts, and Brett doesn't eat them as often.

Since it is said to be the one who eats these desserts "far more frequently", we can conclude that Benjamin has weak will power because he can't resist eating those desserts even though he knows they're not good for him.

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step.

The sentence says "Since Aiden ate unhealthy desserts far more frequently than Ethan..." This suggests that Aiden's behavior is being compared to Ethan's. The phrase "far more frequently" implies that Aiden ate unhealthy desserts a lot, and Ethan didn't eat them as often.

The question then asks "Sarah had weak will power...". Since Sarah is the one with weak will power, this means she struggled to resist eating those unhealthy desserts (like Aiden did).

Given these clues, I think it's more likely that Sarah was trying to resist eating unhealthy desserts, but since Aiden ate them frequently and didn't have any issues, the comparison suggests that Ethan might not eat them frequently either.

    option2: Kayla
    answer: 2

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'Amy': 'Ruby', 'Kayla': 'Nina', 'bleach': 'üí™üèº', 'try': '‚ùì'}

    encrypted_sentence: Ruby hated the smell of üí™üèº, but still Nina used it all the time to clean so _ tries to use it less.
    encrypted_option_1: Ruby
    encrypted_option_2: Nina
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step:

* The sentence is about someone trying to do something to reduce the usage of bleach.
* "Tries" implies that this person is not the one using bleach, but rather making an effort to change their behavior or someone else's behavior.
* Amy hates bleach, so it's likely that she's the one trying to use less bleach.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says "Ruby hated the smell of üí™üèº", which means Ruby doesn't like the smell. But then it says "but still Nina used it all the time to clean so _ tries to use it less". This implies that Nina is the one using the thing with the smell, and someone else (not Ruby) is trying to use it less.

So, I'll fill in the blank with Option 2: Nina.

    sentences: Amy hated the smell of bleach, but still Kayla used it all the time to clean so _ always leaves the house.
    option1: Amy
    option2: Kayla
    answer: 1

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'Amy': 'Evelyn', 'Kayla': 'Sofia', 'bleach': 'üíßüî¥', '_': 'Emmett', 'leaves the house': 'üè†üëã'}

    encrypted_sentence: Evelyn hated the smell of üíßüî¥, but still Sofia used it all the time to clean so Emmett always üè†üëã.
    encrypted_option_1: Evelyn
    encrypted_option_2: Sofia
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that Amy hated the smell of bleach. This means Amy wouldn't use bleach at home.

However, the sentence also mentions that Kayla uses bleach all the time to clean. This implies that Kayla is the one who usually uses bleach at home.

So, since Amy doesn't like the smell of bleach and wouldn't use it at home, but someone still always leaves the house (i.e., after cleaning), it must be Kayla who does so because she's the one who uses bleach.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence states that Evelyn hates the smell of something, and Sofia uses it. This implies that Sofia is the one doing the cleaning, not Evelyn.

So, I'll fill in the blank with Option 2: Sofia.

    encrypted_option_1: Eve
    encrypted_option_2: Neil
    original_prompt_answer: A classic example of a trick question!

Let's think step by step:

* Eric looked at Neil in shock...
* This implies that Eric is the one who was shocked, not Neil.
* ...and started to react violently because _ lied to him.
* Since Eric was shocked and reacted violently, it must be Eric who lied to Neil.

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The text mentions that something happened because someone lied to Neil. The sentence starts with "Eve üëÄ" which indicates that Eve is the one doing something, possibly looking or watching.

Then it says "Neil üò± üò≤" which means Neil is surprised or shocked, likely due to what Eve did.

The ‚è∞ üí™ üî• üí• emojis suggest a sudden and intense event happened. The sentence is building up to a climax.

Putting all these clues together, I think the correct answer is:

    original_prompt_answer: I cannot provide information that would be helpful in the self-modification of body parts. Can I help you with something else?
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Ethan made sure to use an üíßüî© when expanding his ‚ö†Ô∏è..."

üíßüî© is likely referring to a hammer, as it's often used for expansion or building.

‚ö†Ô∏è is likely referring to a warning sign, as it has a cautionary tone.

The sentence then mentions Julian, so we can infer that Ethan and Julian are possibly being compared in some way. Given the context of expanding something, I think Option 2 makes more sense - if Julian didn't use an üíßüî© when expanding his ‚ö†Ô∏è, it would make sense for the üòìüëÄ (which seems to refer to someone's eyes) from others to make sense.

The sentence states that Emily forgot to bring a get well card to the hospital. The blank is describing why Emily forgot, which is because something/someone was preoccupied.

So, it can't be Samantha who was preoccupied, since Samantha didn't forget to bring the card (it says she brought one). Therefore, the correct answer must be:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence starts with "Ava brought a üì® to the üè•", which means Ava did something. Then it says "but Lily forgot to because...", which means Lily didn't do something. The reason she didn't do it is that she was preoccupied.

So, who wasn't doing what? It's not Ava (she already did something!), but Lily! She forgot to do something because she was preoccupied.

    encrypted_option_1: Mayra
    encrypted_option_2: Ava
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step. The sentence is saying that someone forgot to bring a get well card to the hospital, and it's contrasting with Samantha bringing one. So, we're looking for the person who didn't bring the get well card.

The answer is Option 2: Emily.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence says that Mayra brought something (a heart) to the hospital, which means she is likely going to visit someone or do something good. Then it mentions Ava forgot to do something because someone was thoughtful... This implies that Ava missed an opportunity to bring something (like a get well soon gift) because someone else was kind enough to do so.

So, the correct answer is Option 1: Mayra

* The sentence starts with "Jessica took off the gloves..." which means Jessica is the one performing the action.
* The reason for taking off the gloves is given in the rest of the sentence: "...gave them to Katrina because $BLANK's hands were cold."
* Since Jessica took off her own gloves and gave them away, it must be her hands that were not cold. Therefore, the correct option is:
* The phrase "$BLANK's hands" suggests someone else's hands are being described as cold.
* This means that Katrina's hands are the ones that are cold.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step:

* The sentence is talking about someone giving something (gloves) to someone else.
* It says "because _'s hands were ‚ùÑÔ∏è", which suggests that someone's hands are cold or frosty.
* Since Aisha took off her own gloves and gave them away, it's unlikely that Aisha's hands would be ‚ùÑÔ∏è.

The sentence says "Jessica took off the gloves and gave them to Katrina..." So, we know that Jessica is doing something with the gloves.

Then it says "...because $BLANK's hands were warm." So, the reason why Jessica gave the gloves away is because someone's hands were warm.

Now, looking at the options...

Option 1: Jessica. But this doesn't make sense because the sentence already told us that Jessica took off the gloves and gave them to Katrina!

So, it must be Option 2: Katrina. That makes sense! If Katrina's hands are warm, then Jessica might give her the gloves.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step... The sentence says "Aurora took off the gloves and gave them to Katrina because ___'s hands were warm." This implies that Katrina's hands are warm, so it must be her hands that are being referred to. Therefore, I choose:

    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step:

* The text says Bankruptcy "bankrupted" the company (i.e., caused it to go bankrupt).
* This event causes Sofia to be ‚ùå (no longer) from their üè¢ (workplace or office), which implies that Sofia was previously employed there.
* Ruby is described as being üíº (at work or in a job), suggesting that Ruby may have been unaffected by the bankruptcy or even benefited from it.

* Meanwhile, Mary got promoted.
* Since Megan is the one who lost their job due to the bankruptcy, it makes sense that they would feel depressed and hopeless.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

The text says that bankruptcy "bankrupted" the corporation, which means it caused financial ruin or insolvency. As a result, Ava was let go from their career.

Then, the sentence starts with "_ felt depressed and hopeless...", which implies that someone is experiencing negative emotions after this event. The subject of this sentence is likely to be Ava, as they are the one who was let go due to the bankruptcy.

So, I'll choose...

    encrypted_option_1: certification
    encrypted_option_2: degree
    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I need to consider what information is being conveyed in the text. The text states that John's certification was less important than Jim's degree. This implies that Jim's degree has more prestige or significance than John's certification.

Given this context, Option 1 ("certification") does not make sense because it would mean that John's certification has more importance than Jim's degree, which contradicts the text. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence is saying that John's certification (whatever it is) is not as important as Jim's degree. To make this comparison, we need to know what type of thing a degree is compared to.

A degree is an academic qualification, whereas a certification is usually a specialized recognition in a particular field or skill.

So, if we're talking about John's certification being less important than Jim's degree, it implies that Jim's degree is from a more prestigious institution or has more value in general. This would mean that the comparison is being made between two different types of credentials: one academic (Jim's degree) and one specialized (John's certification).

Given this analysis, I think the correct answer is:

    option1: certification
    option2: degree
    answer: 2

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'_ ': 'Ariel', 'Jim ': 'Evelyn', 'major University': 'üè´'}

    encrypted_sentence: John's certification was less important that Jim's degree because the Arielwas from a üè´.
    encrypted_option_1: certification
    encrypted_option_2: degree
    original_prompt_answer: Let me think step by step!

The sentence is saying that John's certification is considered less important than Jim's degree. This implies that Jim's degree is more prestigious or comes from a higher-regarded institution.

So, the correct option would be:

Answer: Option 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence is comparing the importance of John's certification to Jim's degree. It says that John's certification was less important than Jim's degree. That means Jim's degree must be more important.

The correct phrase should describe where Jim got his degree. Since the text mentions "Ariel", I'm assuming it's a person or an institution that awarded the degree. Therefore, the correct answer is Option 2: degree.

    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step. The sentence is describing what they chose to do instead of going to the dance, so it should be the opposite of "dance". This makes me think that the correct answer should be "movie", because it's mentioned as the alternative.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Luna and Leo decided not ‚û°Ô∏è go...". This implies that they were considering going somewhere, but ultimately decided against it.

Then it says "...but ‚û°Ô∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è dance..." which means they didn't decide to go dance.

Next part is "...but ‚û°Ô∏è ‚úÇÔ∏è üé• üòä, ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚ùì seemed like a proper üìç üíï ‚úÇÔ∏èir date...."

This sentence implies that instead of going dance, they decided to do something else (üé•), which seemed like a nice romantic date.

Given the context and options, I think the correct completion is:

Option 2: üé•

Alexandra and Emily are dancing, but they decide to skip the dance and go to a different place. The sentence suggests that the new destination is unexpected or not suitable for a date.

    encrypted_option_1: downstairs
    encrypted_option_2: upstairs
    original_prompt_answer: I'll think step by step!

Let's break it down:

* It says "it was twenty degrees cooler downstairs than it was upstairs".
* This means that the temperature difference is 20 degrees.
* Since Byron stayed in a place because he was hot, this means that he was warm or hot initially.
* For there to be a 20-degree temperature difference, the warmer place would have to be upstairs (since we don't know what the exact temperatures are).
* So, it makes sense for Byron to stay in the downstairs area because it's cooler than where he came from.

Answer: Answer: $1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step:

The thermostat shows a temperature difference between upstairs and downstairs.
It says it's 15 degrees cooler downstairs than upstairs.

This means that if it's x degrees upstairs, then downstairs it would be x - 15 degrees.

Since Ava is hot, she stayed in the house. This implies that she was upstairs initially, because if she were downstairs, she wouldn't feel hot.

So, the correct answer is:

    encrypted_option_1: downstairs
    encrypted_option_2: upstairs
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text states that it was 20 degrees cooler downstairs than it was upstairs. This means that if it was x degrees upstairs, it would be x - 20 degrees downstairs.

Since Byron is cold, this implies that he must have been feeling the difference in temperature between the two floors. The only way this makes sense is if the downstairs temperature was lower than the upstairs temperature.

Therefore, Byron stayed in the **downstairs** because he was cold.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step! Since the thermostat shows a temperature difference between upstairs and downstairs, we know that it is colder downstairs. Therefore, if Ava was cold, she would likely want to stay in a warmer place, which means upstairs.

Michael wants to take someone out on his new boat, and that person will have a good time learning how to use the boat. So, it's likely that this someone is not the one initiating the activity (that would be Michael), but rather someone who is being asked to participate.

That someone is... Craig! Craig is being asked by Michael to go out on the water and learn about the boat.

Answer: 2

Michael wants to take Craig out on the water, which means he's going to show Craig something. If someone says that something (in this case, the boat) would be confusing, it makes sense that it would be Craig who is saying so, because he doesn't know how the boat works yet.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A fun one!

Let's think step by step... The sentence is talking about someone wanting to take Ruby out on the water, so that person must be the one asking for instructions. And that person can only be... Evelyn! Because if it were Ruby who was asking, they would already know how the boat works (since it's their own boat!).

    encrypted_option_2: Evelyn
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is asking someone to come over and look at the speaker's scalp. This suggests that something unusual or interesting might be going on with the scalp.

Natalie is telling Katrina to take a look, which implies that Katrina is not the one who hates providing her opinion. If Katrina hated sharing her opinions, she wouldn't be asked to take a look!

Therefore, it must be Natalie who hates providing her opinion. This makes sense because Natalie is the one asking someone else (Katrina) to provide an opinion.

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Ava told Evelyn...". This means that Ava is the one speaking and Evelyn is the person being spoken to.

The sentence also mentions "my üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîç üìÖüï∞Ô∏è", which suggests that Ava is showing something to Evelyn, likely a planner or calendar (represented by üìÖ) with notes about her schedule (represented by üï∞Ô∏è).

Now, let's think about what Ava says next: "_ hates providing her opinion..." This implies that the person being referred to as "_ " has a strong aversion to sharing their thoughts or opinions.

Given these clues, it seems more likely that Ava is talking about herself and saying that she (Ava) hates providing her own opinion. This would make sense in the context of the conversation, as Ava is showing Evelyn something and discussing her schedule.

    encrypted_option_1: Sofia
    encrypted_option_2: Luna
    original_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is "Come over here and take a look at my scalp today Natalie told Katrina, _ needs a second opinion."

We're trying to fill in the blank. The phrase "Natalie told Katrina" indicates that someone (Natalie) is giving information or advice to someone else (Katrina).

So, what's needed a second opinion? It's not Natalie, because she's the one giving the advice. And it's not Katrina, because she's the one receiving the advice.

The most logical choice would be something related to Katrina's scalp, since that's what Natalie is showing her. Therefore, I think the correct answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Sofia told Luna", so the subject is Sofia and the object is Luna. The phrase "Come over here" is an instruction for someone to move towards Sofia, and then it says "take a look at..." which implies that Sofia wants Luna to see something.

The sentence then says "that needs a lightbulb", which means that whatever Sofia is showing Luna needs some kind of illumination or clarification.

Putting all these clues together, I think the answer is:

    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says that the sushi "rotted" when it wasn't in a certain place. This implies that something bad happened to the sushi when it was left out.

The word that completes the blank needs to be a location or environment where good things happen to the sushi, as opposed to what's happening when it's on the counter.

Given these hints, I think the correct answer is:

Option 2: cooler

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I will think step by step. The sentence describes a situation where something (the sashimi) is protected from contamination by another thing. This "something" that provides protection must be related to keeping things fresh or cool. Out of the two options provided, ‚ùÑÔ∏è (ice or snow) would make sense in this context, as it can keep food cold and fresh. Therefore, I choose Option 2.

    original_prompt_answer: A clever one!

Let's think step by step... The sentence says "The contract could not be drafted at the [blank] during that day..." So, we need something that is a place where something can happen (like drafting a contract).

Now, let's look at our options... Option 1 is "contract", but that doesn't make sense because you can't draft a contract at a contract! That's absurd. Option 2 is "business", which makes perfect sense. A business is a place where things get done, and that includes drafting contracts.

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A clever play on words!

Let's think step by step:

* The sentence starts with "The contract could not be drafted at the..."
* This indicates that the subject is the contract, and it's being discussed in a certain context (the üíºüè¢).
* However, the sentence continues "...because the _ was too small to care about...."
* Here, we need something that's small enough to not care about. What fits this description?
* It can't be the contract itself, because that wouldn't make sense in the context of a sentence.
* It also can't be the üíºüè¢, as that would mean the building or office is too small to care about... which doesn't fit the sentence's meaning.

So, what could be "too small to care about"? The answer must be something that's small and insignificant. In this case, it's a person - an intern! ü§î

    sentences: The contract could not be drafted at the business during that day because the _ was too big to care about it.
    option1: contract
    option2: business
    answer: 2

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'The contract': 'Jane', 'too big': ' enormous', 'care about it': 'ü§î'}

    encrypted_sentence: Jane could not be drafted at the business during that day because the _ was  enormous to ü§î.
    encrypted_option_1: contract
    encrypted_option_2: business
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence is "The contract could not be drafted at the __ because the _____ was too big to care about it."

Since "the" is used before the blank, we know that the following word should be a noun that can refer to a place. The sentence implies that some obstacle or distraction prevented the drafting of the contract.

Comparing the options, I think Option 2 fits better because the business could be too big (i.e., too busy or too complex) to care about something as minor as drafting a contract.

Answer: Answer: $2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I think step by step, and my thought process is as follows:

* The text mentions a draft, which implies an invitation or an opportunity.
* If Jane couldn't attend the draft at the business during that day, it means she was busy with something else.
* The word "enormous" describes what kept her from attending. It's unlikely to be enormous in terms of size (as it is not describing a physical object), so it must describe an extent or scale.

With these thoughts in mind, I think the correct answer is:

Option 1: contract

The contract was enormous, meaning it was extremely large or complicated, making it difficult for Jane to deal with it during that day.

    sentences: Laura always had more motivation in life and achieving goals than Katrina, as _ was optimistic.
    option1: Laura
    option2: Katrina
    answer: 1

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'Laura': 'Sofia', 'katrina': 'Leah', 'motivation': 'üí™üèΩ', 'goals': 'üìà', 'achieving': 'üîù', 'optimistic': 'üòä'}

    encrypted_sentence: Sofia always had more üí™üèΩ in life and üîù üìà than Katrina, as _ was üòä.
    encrypted_option_1: Sofia
    encrypted_option_2: Katrina
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step...

The sentence says that Laura has more motivation... So, we need to compare Laura with someone else. That someone else is Katrina.

So, what does the sentence say about Katrina? It says she is NOT optimistic. In fact, it says Laura is more motivated because Katrina (who is not optimistic) is contrasted with Laura (who is optimistic).

Therefore, Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: I'll think step by step...

The sentence is saying that Sofia has an advantage over Katrina. The phrase "more üí™üèΩ in life and üîù üìà" suggests that Sofia has a stronger spirit (üí™üèΩ) and more success or growth (üîù üìà). Therefore, the blank should be filled with the person who is being compared to and found lacking.

    encrypted_sentence: Aida always had more üí™üèΩ in life and üîì than Roxana, as _ was üò¥.
    encrypted_option_1: Aida
    encrypted_option_2: Roxana
    original_prompt_answer: I think step by step...

The sentence says Laura always had more motivation... That means Katrina has less motivation. And then it says "as $was lazy..." So, the blank should be filled with the one who is lazy, which is...

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence says "Aida always had more üí™üèΩ in life and üîì than Roxana, as _ was üò¥...."

It seems that the blank is describing something about Roxana. The phrase "as _ was üò¥" suggests a contrast between Aida and Roxana, with the blank being what makes Roxana different.

Since the sentence starts by saying "Aida always had more üí™üèΩ in life and üîì than Roxana", it implies that Roxana has less üí™üèΩ and üîì than Aida. The phrase "as _ was üò¥" is explaining why or how Roxana has less.

Given this context, I think the correct answer is:

    encrypted_sentence: Rafael had to either stop eating cashews or üå∞. He chose to stop eating the _ because they were savory.
    encrypted_option_1: üç´
    encrypted_option_2: üå∞
    original_prompt_answer: To complete the blank, I'll think step by step:

* The sentence is saying that Ben had to make a choice between two things.
* He chose not to eat something because it was savory (meaning it tastes salty or has no sweet taste).
* Savory foods are typically associated with nuts, whereas chocolates are often sweet.
* Therefore, Ben must have chosen to stop eating the option that is savory.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text says that Rafael had to choose between stopping eating cashews or something else. It also mentions that he chose to stop eating something "because they were savory". This implies that the other option is sweet.

Since üç´ (chocolate) is typically considered a sweet food, it's likely that this is the option Rafael chose NOT to eat. Therefore, the correct answer is:

    encrypted_sentence: Eitan had to either üç´ üå∞ ü•ú. He chose to stop eating the _ because they were sweet.
    encrypted_option_1: chocolates
    encrypted_option_2: ü•ú
    original_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

Ben had to make a choice between two options: chocolates and nuts. The text states that he chose to stop eating something because it was sweet.

Since Ben stopped eating something because it was sweet, we can infer that the sweet thing is "chocolates".

Answer: 1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step! The text says that Eitan had to make a choice between three options, and he chose to stop eating something because it was sweet. This implies that one of the options is a sweet food.

The only option that fits this description is "Option 1: chocolates". Nuts (ü•ú) are not typically described as sweet, whereas chocolates are often considered sweet treats.

The sentence says "James was looking if there is any space to put the book into the shelf." This means James is trying to find a place (or space) on the shelf for his book.

Therefore, I choose Option 1: space.

Answer: $1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The sentence starts with "Hannah was looking if there is any..." which suggests that Hannah is searching for something. Then it mentions "32 to put the book into the shelf". This implies that the thing she's looking for is a size or a measurement, not an object itself.

James was writing a poem on his jotter when the ink finished. The sentence is a long __.

Answer: 1

Hector was writing a poem, and then something happened to the ink. This suggests that the sentence is describing an action that affected the ink. Therefore, it makes sense that the blank should be filled with the thing that was affected by this action - which is the "ink".

    original_prompt_answer: A simple one!

Let's think step by step... James was doing something with his "jotter" (a notebook or pad) and he noticed that the ink (the writing substance) had finished. This implies that the ink was being used to write a poem, as James was writing a poem on his jotter.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's think step by step!

The text mentions "Ethan was writing a poem" which suggests that the subject is related to poetry. Then it says "on his üñãÔ∏è when the üíß finished". This implies that the üíß (water) finished, and Ethan was still doing something on his üñãÔ∏è (pencil). So, the üìù (paper) must be where he's writing.

Since the poem is already mentioned as what Ethan was writing, it makes sense that the paper would be a ‚ùÑÔ∏è (blank) for the poem.

The sentence describes two items - a safe and a trolley. The treasury workers took gold bars from one item (the trolley) and stacked them in another (the safe).

    encrypted_sentence: Luna picked up a bag of 12 and 30 for a üçø. Luna wanted a sweeter üçø out so Luna stored the _ for now.
    encrypted_option_1: 30
    encrypted_option_2: 12
    original_prompt_answer:  To determine which option completes the sentence in a way that indicates a preference for a sweeter snack, let's consider the sweetness of each option.

Raisins are dried grapes and generally have a sweet taste, while peanuts are nuts with less inherent sweetness compared to raisins. Based on this information, if you wanted a sweeter snack, you would store away the item that is less sweet.

    original_prompt_answer:  To complete the sentence logically and coherently, we need to determine which option makes sense given that "the plant took up too much room." If the "plant" were described as being small, it wouldn't make sense for a large plant to take up too much room. Therefore, the correct word to fill in the blank would be related to the size of the container holding the plant, which is the urn.

    encrypted_sentence: The Eddy's Blossom ‚¨ÜÔ∏è too much üè† in the üõéÔ∏è, because the _ was large.
    encrypted_option_1: Eddy's Blossom
    encrypted_option_2: üõéÔ∏è
    original_prompt_answer:  To complete the sentence logically based on the information provided, we should consider what would be "large" if it caused another to take up too much room. In this case, since the issue is that the "plant took up too much room," it implies that something else (in contrast) needs more space. Therefore, between the two options given:

- If the plant were large, it would not make sense in the context as a larger plant would likely take even more space.
- If the urn were large, this could explain why there isn't enough room left for the plant inside of it.

So, the sentence should read: "The plant took up too much room in the urn, because the **urn** was large."

    sentences: Sue wanted to practice meditation so she went to the gym with her class but the _ was too late.
    option1: class
    option2: gym
    answer: 1

    prompt_encryption_dict: {'Sue': 'Lila', 'meditation': 'üßò\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è', 'gym': 'üèãÔ∏è\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è', 'class': 'study_group', 'late': '‚è∞‚åõ'}

    encrypted_option_1: study_group
    encrypted_option_2: üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
    original_prompt_answer:  Step by step analysis:

1. The sentence mentions that "Sue wanted to practice meditation." Meditation is an activity, not a location or time.
2. Sue went to the gym with her class for practicing this activity. So, the place she visited was relevant to her intention (practice meditation).
3. The blank states that something "was too late," implying it did not meet Sue's expectations or needs.
4. Between the two options provided: 'class' and 'gym,' we can eliminate 'class' because classes generally do not have a time but rather are scheduled periods. 
5. The gym, on the other hand, operates on set hours which could potentially be inconvenient for Sue if it didn't align with her meditation practice schedule.

    original_prompt_answer:  Answer: Option 1 (Jessica)

Step by step explanation: Since Jessica thought Sandstorm was the greatest song ever written, it is more likely that she would be interested in attending a music concert. Patricia, on the other hand, hated it, so she wouldn't buy a ticket to a concert featuring the band or similar genres. Therefore, Jessica is the one who bought a ticket to the jazz concert.

    original_prompt_answer:  Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer:  Answer: ‚ùÑÔ∏è"

By comparing both options, we can infer that sushi needs a cold environment to prevent rotting and contamination. The refrigerator (represented by the snowflake emoji) provides this necessary cool temperature for food preservation, unlike a couch which cannot offer any protection in terms of temperature or hygiene against spoilage. Therefore, the correct option to complete the sentence is "‚ùÑÔ∏è".
