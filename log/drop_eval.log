    encrypted_question: ('How many points did the buccaneers need to tie in the first?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: To answer this question, we need to find out who scored what and when.

The passage says that the Buccaneers tied it up with a 38-yard field goal by Connor Barth. So, the Buccaneers needed 7 points (since the Lions had already scored 3) to tie in the first quarter.

Answer: 7
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, we need to identify when the Buccaneers tied the game with a 38-yard field goal by Hannah. This happened after Emily's 42-yard field goal for the Lions. Therefore, the Lions must have been leading by:

42 (Lions' field goal) - 38 (Buccaneers' field goal) = 4

So, the Buccaneers needed to score at least 5 points to tie the game.

    encrypted_question: ('How many yards was the shortest touchdown scoring play?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The passage mentions two touchdown plays with distances less than or equal to 1 yard (the catch by Calvin Johnson in the third quarter) and another one with a distance of 11 yards (the pass to Tony Scheffler). Since we're looking for the shortest touchdown scoring play, we can rule out the 11-yard pass.

The remaining two options are both less than or equal to 1 yard: the 1-yard pass caught by Calvin Johnson and the 5-yard pass caught by Mike Williams. However, since we're asked about the shortest touchdown scoring play, it must be the 1-yard pass.

Answer: $1
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, we need to identify all the touchdown plays and find the shortest one.

From the passage, we can see that there were two touchdowns in the second quarter:

* Calvin Johnson caught a 36-yard touchdown pass.
* Tobias caught an 11-yard TD pass.

The shortest touchdown scoring play was therefore the 11-yard TD pass.

Tampa Bay responded with a 31-yard field goal just before halftime. The second half was relatively quiet, with each team only scoring one touchdown. First, Detroit's Cora Lee caught a 1-yard pass in the third quarter. The game's final points came when Mike Williams of Tampa Bay caught a 5-yard pass.  The Lions won their regular season opener for the first time since 2007
    encrypted_question: ('How many points were scored first?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: The passage states that the Lions scored first with a 23-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, and the Buccaneers responded with a 38-yard field goal by Connor Barth. Therefore, the total number of points scored first is:

3 (Jason Hanson's field goal) + 3 (Connor Barth's field goal) = 6

Answer: 6
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I'll need to go through the passage step by step.

The passage mentions that the Lions scored a 42-yard field goal in the first quarter, which is the first score of the game. Then, the Buccaneers tied it up with a 35-yard field goal, followed by Tampa Bay taking the lead after Ava Russell's interception and run-in. The Lions responded with a 28-yard field goal.

So, the first points scored were from the Lions' 42-yard field goal.

    passage: Trying to snap a two-game skid, the Bills flew to Gillette Stadium for a Week 3 divisional fight with the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, QB J. P. Losman was immediately injured on the first offensive play of the game.  He would finish the series, but ended up on the bench for the rest of the game.  After New England took the lead with kicker Stephen Gostkowski's 24-yard field goal, rookie QB Trent Edwards played the rest of the game for Buffalo.  The Bills would get their only score of the game as RB Marshawn Lynch got an 8-yard TD run, and a Rian Lindell extra point put the Bills ahead surprisingly 7-3.  However, in the second quarter, the Patriots were able to open up their running game when Bills rookie standout Paul Posluszny was lost due to a broken arm. This left passing lanes open, and for the rest of the game, the Patriots dominated. QB Tom Brady's 8-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson and a 3-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss made it 17-7 at the half.  In the third quarter, New England continued its conquest with Brady's 4-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney and RB Sammy Morris' 4-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots ended the day with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 45-yard TD pass.

Losman was immediately injured on the first offensive play of the game.  He would finish the series, but ended up on the bench for the rest of the game.  After New England took the lead with kicker Stephen Gostkowski's 24-yard field goal, rookie QB Trent Edwards played the rest of the game for Buffalo.  The Bills would get their only score of the game as RB Marshawn Lynch got an 8-yard TD run, and a Rian Lindell extra point put the Bills ahead surprisingly 7-3.  However, in the second quarter, the Patriots were able to open up their running game when Bills rookie standout Paul Posluszny was lost due to a broken arm. This left passing lanes open, and for the rest of the game, the Patriots dominated. QB Tom Brady's 8-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson and a 3-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss made it 17-7 at the half.  In the third quarter, New England continued its conquest with Brady's 4-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney and RB Sammy Morris' 4-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots ended the day with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 45-yard TD pass.

    passage: Trying to snap a two-game skid, the Bills flew to Gillette Stadium for a Week 3 divisional fight with the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, QB J. P. Losman was immediately injured on the first offensive play of the game.  He would finish the series, but ended up on the bench for the rest of the game.

The Bills had only one touchdown, which was an 8-yard TD run by Marshawn Lynch. The Patriots had five touchdowns: two passing touchdowns (one to Benjamin Watson and one to Randy Moss), two rushing touchdowns (one to Sammy Morris), and one passing touchdown to Jabar Gaffney.

Therefore, the Patriots scored four more touchdowns than the Bills.

2. Brady's 3-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss

* The Bills got their only score of the game as RB Marshawn Lynch got an 8-yard TD run, and a Rian Lindell extra point put the Bills ahead surprisingly 7-3.

Adding these up, we get:

3 + 7 = 10

So, there were 10 points scored in the first half.
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I need to identify all the scores mentioned in the passage.

In the first quarter, the Bills were ahead 7-3.
Then, at the end of the second quarter, the Patriots took the lead with two touchdowns, making it 17-7.

So, there are 10 points scored in the first half: the Bills' 7 and the Patriots' 17.

    passage: The French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Br√©tigny set his ransom at 3¬†million¬†crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre  since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as king of France. On 7 May 1364, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel.

    encrypted_question: ('How many years before Navarrase used the captivity of Pierre?', 9.090909090909092)
    original_prompt_answer: According to the passage, the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in 1363. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre since 1354, so we can subtract 9 from 1363 to get:

1354 - 9 = 1355
    encrypted_prompt_answer: The passage states that the French crown had been at odds with the English since 1354, and Pierre was captured in a castle (not specifically stated which one). It also mentions that Pierre died while still captive.

Since Navarrase is not mentioned in the passage as being involved in the captivity of Pierre, it implies that Navarrase is not part of the story. Therefore, there are no years before Navarrase used the captivity of Pierre because Navarrase was not involved in the situation.

While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre  since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as king of France. On 7 May 1364, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel.

    encrypted_question: ('How many years passed betwwen the French dispute with Navarre and the leverage of the captivity of Jean-Luc?', 5.263157894736842)
    original_prompt_answer: According to the passage, the French dispute with Navarre started in 1354 and John II was captured in England around the same time. He died in 1364. Therefore, it took approximately 10 years for the French dispute with Navarre to mature and utilize the leverage of John II's captivity.

Answer: 10
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, we need to find out when the French dispute with Navarre started (1354) and when Jean-Luc was captured (not explicitly stated in the passage, but it's implied that he was already captive before Louis of Anjou escaped). We can assume that Jean-Luc was captured sometime after 1354.

So, we have two dates: 1354 (start of dispute with Navarre) and 1362 (Louis of Anjou escapes).

Subtracting the earlier date from the later one gives us:

1362 - 1354 = 8

Therefore, it took 8 years for the French dispute with Navarre to leverage the captivity of Jean-Luc.

    encrypted_question: ('How many years after Pierre returned to captivity did he die?', 8.333333333333332)
    original_prompt_answer: According to the passage, John II returned to captivity in England when his son Louis escaped and he felt honor-bound to return. This was around 1362. He died in London in 1364. Therefore, it took John II approximately 2 years after returning to captivity for him to die.

Answer: 2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, we need to find out when Pierre returned to captivity and then calculate how many years passed until his death.

According to the passage, Pierre was held captive in England initially, but it doesn't specify exactly when he was captured or when he escaped. However, we do know that one of his sons escaped while still a hostage (in 1364), which means Pierre must have been captured sometime before this event.

It is not explicitly stated how long Pierre had been held captive before his son's escape, but since the passage mentions the French crown trying to raise funds to pay the ransom and negotiating with Edward, it can be inferred that some time passed. Nevertheless, we cannot determine exactly when Pierre returned to captivity or how many years passed until his death.

    original_prompt_answer: According to the passage, the French were at odds with Navarre since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese attempted to seize power. Therefore, it took 9 years for this to happen.

Answer: 9
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The passage states that the French were at odds with Navarre since 1354, and in 1363, the Navarrese used this situation to try to seize power.

To find the number of years that passed, we need to subtract 1354 from 1363:

1363 - 1354 = 9

So, Answer: 9

    original_prompt_answer: The passage states that "John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom" while his sons were held hostage. Later, it says that "With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations." This implies that John was still being held captive in England. The passage then concludes with "In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity." Therefore, yes, John was in captivity when he died.

    original_prompt_answer: The passage does not mention the exact date of the Battle of Cocherel, but it mentions that John II died in 1364 and the Battle of Cocherel occurred one month after his death and three days before Charles V's coronation. The Treaty of Br√©tigny is mentioned as occurring before John's captivity, so it must have occurred earlier than 1362 (when Louis of Anjou escaped) and before 1363 (when the Navarrese tried to seize power). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: Treaty of Br√©tigny
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The passage mentions that Henri died in London while still in honourable captivity, and this event occurred in an unspecified year.

The passage also mentions the Battle of Cocherel, which happened on May 7th, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V.

The Treaty of Br√©tigny is mentioned earlier in the passage, but it doesn't specify a date. However, we know that Henri was held captive before this treaty was signed, which allowed for John to be held in lieu of him.

Now, let's look at the timeline:

* Henri died in London
* The dauphin succeeded him as king and coronation occurred (Battle of Cocherel happened three days before)
* The dauphin's accession and coronation were one month apart

Based on this information, we can conclude that:

1. Henri died first
2. The Battle of Cocherel happened after Henri's death and the dauphin's accession/coronation

So, in total, at least 2 (sons) + several (princes and nobles) + 4 (Paris) + 38 (two citizens from each of the 19 towns) = 44 people were held hostage in place of John II.

    question: How many years did John II live after returning to captivity in Ingland in 1362?

    encrypted_passage: The üá´üá∑, Pierre, had been held captive in üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø. The Treaty of Br√©tigny set his ransom at 3¬†million¬†crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre  since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of Pierre in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, Pierre died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as king of France. On 7 May 1364, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's break down the passage:

The passage tells us that as of the census of 2000, there were:
- 218,590 people
- 60,387 families

To find out how many more people there are than families, we subtract the number of families from the number of people:
- 218,590 (people) - 60,387 (families) = 158,203

So, there were 158,203 more people than families.

Answer: 158,203
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To find the answer, I need to subtract the number of families from the total population.

According to the passage, there were 218,206 people and 60 families.

    original_prompt_answer: To find the percentage that are not German, I will subtract the percentage that are German from 100%.

German is 22.5%, so to find the percentage that are not German, I'll do:

100 - 22.5 = 77.5%

So, Answer: 77.5%

First, I'll find the percentages that are not Irish:

* German: 22.5%
* Italian: 9.8%
* English: 9.2%
* Polish: 6.0%
* Other (not specified): 1.91% (note: this includes Asian, African, and other non-Caucasian races)
* Not specified race: 9.27%

Now, I'll add these percentages together:

22.5 + 9.8 + 9.2 + 6.0 + 9.27 = 57.62

So, the percentage of people who are not Irish is approximately 57.62%.
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break down the passage step by step!

The passage mentions different percentages for various racial/ethnic groups, but it doesn't mention "not Irish" as a specific category. Instead, it lists the percentages of people who identify as Eve, Eve, Eve, and so on.

Since there is no information provided about people who are not Irish, we can conclude that the question is asking us to find a percentage that is not mentioned in the passage. In this case, that would be 0%.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's break down the passage step by step.

The passage states that 1.47% of the population were from two or more races. To find the percentage of people who are not from two or more races, we can subtract this value from 100%.

Answer: 98.53%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To find the percentage of people who are not from two or more races, we need to subtract this value (1.47%) from 100%. 

First, let's convert the percentages to fractions: 
86.77% = 0.8677
9.27% = 0.0927
0.23% = 0.0023
1.52% = 0.0152
0.06% = 0.0006
0.69% = 0.0069
1.91% = 0.0191

Now, add up all these fractions and subtract from 1:
1 - (0.8677 + 0.0927 + 0.0023 + 0.0152 + 0.0006 + 0.0069 + 0.0191) = 
1 - 0.9925 = 0.0075

Now convert this fraction back to percentage: 
0.0075 = 0.75%

So, the answer is:

    original_prompt_answer: To find the answer, we need to subtract the percentage of people who are German (22.5%) from 100%. This gives us:

100% - 22.5% = 77.5%

So, the correct answer is that 77.5% were not German.

Answer: 77.5%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I need to find the percentages that are not German. From the passage, I can see that:

* Race (United States Census) = 9.27%
* Irish people:üçÄ Irish people = 1.52%
* Italian people:üçù Italian people = 1.52%
* English people:üá¨üáß English = 1.52%
* "American":üá∫üá∏ "American" = 1.91%
* Polish people:üáµüá± Polish ancestry = 1.47%

I will add these percentages together to get the total percentage of non-German ancestry:

9.27% + 1.52% + 1.52% + 1.52% + 1.91% + 1.47% = 17.69%

The passage mentions the following percentages of Italian ancestry: 9.8%

To find the percentage that are NOT Italian, we can subtract this number from 100:

100 - 9.8 = 90.2%

So, approximately 90.2% were not Italian.

Answer: 90.2

    encrypted_question: ("How many in percent üíï the census weren't German?", 11.11111111111111)
    original_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I'll identify the percentages of non-German ancestry mentioned in the passage:

* Irish people: 13.1%
* Italian people: 9.8%
* English: 9.2%
* "American": 8.1%
* Polish: 6.0%

I'll subtract these percentages from the total percentage that weren't German (100% - 22.5% = 77.5%). This leaves:

77.5% - 13.1% = 64.4%
77.5% - 9.8% = 67.7%
77.5% - 9.2% = 68.3%
77.5% - 8.1% = 69.4%
77.5% - 6.0% = 71.5%

The lowest percentage is 64.4%, which represents the percentage of people from the census who weren't German.

Answer: 64.4%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I need to find the percentage of people who identified as üíï (two or more races) and subtract it from the percentage of people who identified as German.

According to the passage, 21.2% were German, and 1.50% were two or more races. To find the percentage of people who weren't German but were two or more races, I can calculate:

1.50% (two or more races) - 21.2% (German) = -19.7%

However, since percentages cannot be negative, I know that the correct answer is actually the percentage of people who are two or more races minus the percentage of people who are German.

So, the answer is:

Answer: 1.50% - 21.2% = 0.30%, or 0.3%.
    original_prompt_extracted_answer: 64.4%
    encrypted_prompt_extracted_answer: 1.50% - 21.2% = 0.30%, or 0.3%.

    encrypted_question: ("How many in percent from the census weren't Italian?", 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: To find the answer, we need to subtract the percentage of people who are Italian (9.8%) from the total population that aren't two or more races (1.47%). The remaining percentages add up to 100% minus these values.

First, let's calculate the total number of people not two or more races: 1.91% is less than 2%, so we'll assume this percentage only includes one race. Then, we can subtract it from the total population: 218,590 * (1 - 0.0147) = 214,651.

Now, let's find out how many people are not Italian: 100% - 9.8% = 90.2%. To calculate this percentage as a decimal, divide by 100 and multiply by the total population: 0.902 * 218,590 ‚âà 197,221.5. Finally, subtract the number of Italian people from this total to get non-Italian people: 197,221.5 - (9.8% of the total) = 197,221.5 - (0.098 * 218,590) ‚âà 194,441.

To find the answer as a percentage, divide this value by the total population and multiply by 100: (194,441 / 218,590) * 100 ‚âà 88.8%.

According to the passage, 22.5% of the population were of German ancestry, while 9.2% were of English ancestry.

To compare these two groups, we can convert their percentages to a common unit, such as actual numbers or proportions. For instance, if there are 218,590 people in total, then:

* German: 22.5% √ó 218,590 = 49,267 people
* English: 9.2% √ó 218,590 = 20,135 people

Comparing these values, we can see that the group of German ancestry is significantly larger than the group of English ancestry.

Since the percentage for Germans is given, we can compare it to the other percentages mentioned in the passage.

Among the other percentages mentioned, 9.27% is the largest. Therefore, since Germans have a smaller percentage than this, they are likely the smaller group.

    decrypted_encrypted_answer: The passage does not mention a specific number for the German and 9.2% groups, but it mentions that 22.5% were of German people (8.1%) and 9.2% were of 9.2% 9.2% (no percentage given). Since the percentage for 22.5% is given, we can compare it to the other percentages mentioned in the passage.

Among the other percentages mentioned, 9.27% is the largest. Therefore, since 22.5% have a smaller percentage than this, they are likely the smaller group.

The passage mentions that 22.5% of the population was of German people. This means that the remaining percentage is 100% - 22.5% = 77.5%.

Answer: 77.5%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I'll need to find the percentage of population that are not German. According to the passage, 22.5% of the population was of German people, which means that all other percentages represent non-German populations.

Let's add up the percentages for non-German populations:
9.27% (Race) + 0.23% ( Race) + 1.52% ( Race) + 0.06% ( Race) + 0.69% (from ) + 1.47% (two or more races) = 13.14%

So, the percentage of population that are not German is:

    original_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I will first identify the percentages that are not related to English ancestry, which are:

* German people (22.5%)
* Irish people (13.1%)
* Italian people (9.8%)
* Polish people (6.0%)
* "American" people (8.1%)

Next, I will add up these percentages:

22.5 + 13.1 + 9.8 + 6.0 + 8.1 = 59.5

Finally, since the question asks for the percentage that were not English, I will subtract this total from 100 to find the percentage that are of English ancestry or more:

100 - 59.5 = 40.5%

Therefore, Answer: 40.5
    encrypted_prompt_answer: The passage mentions the racial makeup of the county, including percentages for various ethnic groups. We are asked to find out how many percent were not English.

To do this, we need to subtract the percentage of people who are English from 100%. The passage states that 1.52% of the population is German, Irish people make up 0.69%, Italian people make up 0.23%, and American ancestry makes up 6.0%. Adding these together gives us a total of 9.44%. Therefore, the percentage who are not English is:

100% - 1.52% (German) - 0.69% (Irish) - 0.23% (Italian) - 6.0% (American) = 83.56%

However, this question specifies that we should assume a 0.0 answer if there are no data to support the query. Since the passage does not provide information on other races or ethnicities besides English, we can't determine how many percent were not English.

    encrypted_question: ('How many percent were not American?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: To answer this question, we need to find the percentage of people who are not listed as having "American" ancestry.

From the passage, we know that 8.1% of the population was of "American" ancestry. This means that 91.9% of the population was not of American ancestry.

Answer: 91.9
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step.

The passage states that the question of being "American" was only asked to those who identified as such, which means that everyone else did not identify as "American".

From the passage, we can see that:

* 1.91% identified as one or more races (not specifying American)
* 22.5% identified with German ancestry
* 13.1% identified with Irish ancestry
* 9.8% identified with Italian ancestry
* 9.2% identified with English ancestry
* 8.1% identified as "American" and something else
* 6.0% identified with Polish ancestry

So, subtracting the percentage that identified as "American" (8.1%) from the total percentage of people who did not identify as one or more races (not specifying American) (1.91%), we get:

100 - 22.5 - 13.1 - 9.8 - 9.2 - 8.1 - 6.0 = 32.3%

But wait, there's more! The passage also mentions "from" or "Race (United States Census)" which implies that some people identified with non-American races. If we add these to the total percentage of people who did not identify as American, we get:

1.91 + 22.5 + 13.1 + 9.8 + 9.2 + 6.0 = 62.7%

So, subtracting this from 100, we finally get:

100 - 62.7 = 37.3%

However, the problem statement asks for the percentage that were "not American", not just those who didn't identify as American. To find this out, we need to add back in the people who identified with non-American races.

From the passage, we can see that:

* 9.27% identified with another race (not specifying American)
* 0.69% identified with more than one race
* 1.47% identified with two or more races

Adding these together gives us:

9.27 + 0.69 + 1.47 = 11.43%

Now, subtracting this from the total percentage of people who didn't identify as American (37.3%), we finally get our answer.

Answer: 94.0%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

We're looking for the percentage of people who are not Polish. To find this, we need to subtract the percentage of people with Polish ancestry (6.0%) from the total.

The passage also mentions that "1.47% from two or more races" which means some people may have Polish ancestry but it's not their only race. We don't know how many of these individuals are actually of Polish descent, so we'll assume they're not.

So, let's subtract 6.0% (Polish) from the total percentage of people who aren't "American" or one of the other races mentioned:

100 - 22.5% (German) - 13.1% (Irish) - 9.8% (Italian) - 9.2% (English) - 8.1% ("American") = 37.3%

Now, let's subtract this percentage from the total to get the percentage of people who are not Polish:

100 - 6.0% (Polish) - 37.3% = 56.7%

So, approximately **56.7%** were not Polish.

    encrypted_question: ('How many percent of people were not from 2 or more races?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I need to find the percentage of people who are not listed as being from two or more races.

From the passage, we know that 1.47% of the population is from two or more races. Therefore, the remaining percentage of people who are not from two or more races would be:

100% - 1.47% = 98.53%

However, this value includes people who are Hispanic, which is a separate category. The passage also tells us that 1.91% of the population were Hispanic or Latino (of any race). To find the percentage of people who are not from two or more races and are not Hispanic or Latino, we subtract these percentages:

100% - 1.47% - 1.91% = 96.62%

So, approximately 96.62% of people were not from two or more races.

Answer: 90.2%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's analyze the passage step by step.

The passage mentions that 9.8% of the population has Italian ancestry. This means that if we consider only people with Italian ancestry, it would be a percentage of the total population.

To find out how many percent of the total population is not Italian, we need to subtract the percentage of people who are Italian from the total:

100% - 9.8% = 90.2%

    original_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step.

The passage says that 9.2% of the population were of English ancestry. This means that the remaining percentage are not of English ancestry.

To find this out, we can subtract 9.2% from 100%:

100% - 9.2% = 90.8%

So, approximately 90.8% of the people in the census weren't of English ancestry.

Answer: 90.8%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I will identify the percentages of different ethnic groups mentioned in the passage.

The passage mentions the following percentages:

* German people: 25%
* Scottish people: 15%
* Greek people: 10%
* Welsh people: 10%

I am looking for the percentage of people who are not Welsh. To find this, I will subtract the percentage of Welsh people from 100%.

100% - 10% = 90%

Therefore, 90% of the people in the census were not Welsh.

    encrypted_question: ("How many in percent from the census weren't American?", 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: To answer this question, we need to find out what percentage of the population is not American.

According to the passage, 8.1% are "American". This means that 91.9% are not American (100 - 8.1 = 91.9).

Answer: 91.9
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's analyze the passage step by step.

The passage states that 1.47% of the population were from two or more races, which means that some people might not identify as "American".

Additionally, it mentions that 8.1% identified as "American", so we can subtract this percentage from the total percentage of people who didn't identify as American to get the remaining percentage.

The remaining percentage is 1.91% (people of other races) + 1.47% (people from two or more races) = 3.38%.

However, we need to find out how many people this translates to in terms of percentages. To do this, we can multiply the percentage by the total population.

The passage states that there were 218,590 people residing in the county, so:

3.38% * 218,590 = 7,384

So, approximately 7,384 people did not identify as American.

To express this answer as a percentage of the total population, we can divide by the total population and multiply by 100:

(7,384 / 218,590) * 100 ‚âà 3.38%

However, since we're asked to find out how many in percent from the census weren't American, we should subtract this percentage from 100%:

100% - 3.38% = 96.62%

So, approximately 96.62% of people identified as something other than "American".

    encrypted_question: ('Which group from the census is larger: German or English?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: The passage states that 22.5% of the population were of German ancestry, and 9.2% were of English ancestry. Since 22.5 is greater than 9.2, the group from the census that is larger is German.

Answer: German
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, we need to look at the passage for information about the racial makeup of the county by percentage.

According to the passage, "German people were of German people, Irish people Irish people, Italian people Italian people, English English, 'American' 'American' and Polish ancestry." This suggests that the group percentages are mentioned earlier in the passage under the section "The racial makeup of the county was..."

Looking back at the passage, we see that the racial makeup is listed as follows:

* 86.77% White
* 9.27% Black or African American
* 0.23% American Indian or Alaska Native
* 1.52% Asian
* 0.06% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
* 0.69% Some other race
* 1.47% Two or more races

There is no mention of German or English as distinct racial groups, but rather as ancestry categories. This makes it difficult to compare the sizes of these two groups directly.

However, we can infer that White (86.77%) is likely a larger group than any other racial or ethnic category mentioned in the passage. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that German ancestry and English ancestry are both smaller groups within the broader White category.

We know that 13.1% of the population are Irish people.

To find out what percentage is NOT Irish, we need to subtract this number from 100%.

100% - 13.1% = 86.9%

So, the answer is: Answer: 86.9
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, we need to determine the percentage of people who are not Irish. The passage does not provide a direct answer to this question, so we need to find an alternative way to solve it.

The passage provides information about the population and demographics of the county, including the percentages of different races and ethnicities. However, it does not specifically mention the percentage of people who are Irish or the total number of people in the county.

To answer the question, we can try to find some relevant information that might help us estimate the percentage of people who are not Irish. For example, the passage mentions the total population of the county (218,223), but it does not provide a specific figure for the number of Irish people.

However, if we assume that the number of Irish people is relatively small compared to the total population, we might be able to make an educated guess about the percentage of people who are not Irish. For example, if there are only 1% or 2% of the population who are Irish, then it's likely that most people in the county are not Irish.

Without more specific information, it's difficult to provide a precise answer to this question. However, based on the information provided, we might be able to make an educated estimate about the percentage of people who are not Irish.

    original_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The passage mentions the percentages of different racial groups, including Italian people (which is 9.8%). This means that the remaining percentage of people are not Italian.

To find out what percentage of people are not Italian, we can subtract the percentage of Italian people from 100:

100 - 9.8 = 90.2%

So, approximately 90.2% of the population were not Italian.

Answer: 90.2
    encrypted_prompt_answer: The passage does not provide a direct answer to the question about non-Italian population percentage. However, we can infer that the percentage of people who are not Italian is the total population minus those who are Italian.

According to the passage, "1.47% from two or more races" and "0.69% from (Race)" are mentioned, but there is no specific information about the Italian population percentage. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact percentage of non-Italian people.

However, if we assume that all other racial groups mentioned (German, Irish, English, "American", Polish) are not Italian, then we can consider these groups as non-Italian. In this case, the total percentage of non-Italian population would be:

1.91% (from two or more races) + 0.69% (from ) = 2.60%

To find the percentage of non-Italian people out of the total population, we can subtract this value from 100:

100 - 2.60% = 97.40%

However, please note that this calculation is an estimation and might not be accurate due to the lack of information about Italian population.

    encrypted_question: ('How many percent were not  english?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: To solve this problem, I will subtract the percentage of English ancestry from 100%. This gives me:

100% - 9.2% = 90.8%

So, the answer is:

Answer: 90.8%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To find the answer, I need to subtract the percentage of people with English ancestry (which is 9.2%) from the total population that wasn't solely of English ancestry.

From the passage, we know that 1.91% of the population were Hispanic or Latino. We also know that 6.0% of the population had Polish ancestry, and some percentage of people had German, Irish, Italian, and other non-English ancestries (22.5% in total).

Let's subtract these percentages from the total:

9.2% English + 1.91% Hispanic/Latino = 11.11%

Then, let's subtract the remaining percentages:

22.5% - 6.0% Polish = 16.5%
16.5% - (13.1% Irish + 9.8% Italian) = 14.62%
14.62% - 9.27% Other race = 5.35%

Adding these up, we get:

11.11% + 5.35% = 16.46%

So, the percentage of people who weren't solely English is approximately 16.46%.

    original_prompt_answer: To find the answer, we need to find the total percentage of non-Irish individuals in the county. According to the passage, 86.77% are White (not Irish), 9.27% are Black or African American, 0.23% are Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.52% are Asian, 0.06% are Some other race, and 1.47% are Two or more races. These percentages add up to a total of 99.12%, which means that the remaining 0.88% (100% - 99.12%) do not identify as White, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, Asian, or Some other race.

Among these individuals, we know that 22.5% are German, 13.1% are Irish, 9.8% are Italian, 9.2% are English, 8.1% are "American", and 6.0% are Polish. Since 13.1% identify as Irish, the remaining percentage of non-Irish individuals would be 100% - 22.5% - 13.1% = 64.24%.

    original_prompt_answer: To find the percentage that are not American, I'll first identify the percentages that mention a specific ethnicity or nationality (German, Irish, Italian, English, Polish). These make up:

* 22.5% German
* 13.1% Irish
* 9.8% Italian

Adding these up, I get: 22.5 + 13.1 + 9.8 + 9.2 + 6.0 = 61.6%

Since the question asks for "not American", I'll subtract this from 100 to find the percentage that are not American:

We are given percentages of people with specific ancestries:

* German: 22.5%
* Irish: 13.1%
* Italian: 9.8%
* English: 9.2%
* "American": 8.1%
* Polish: 6.0%

100 - 6.0 = 94.0%

So, the answer is:

Answer: 94%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To find the answer to this question, we need to subtract the percentage of people with Polish ancestry from the total population.

The passage doesn't give us the exact percentage of people with Polish ancestry, but it does say that "German", "Irish", "Italian", "English", and "American" were mentioned as ancestries. This implies that these percentages must add up to 1.47% (since there are many more than just Polish people). Therefore, the percentage of people not having Polish ancestry is 100 - 1.47 = 98.53%.

    encrypted_question: ("How many in percent from the census weren't Irish?", 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I will look for information on percentages of people that aren't Irish.

Answer: 92.9%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I will first identify the percentages mentioned in the passage that are not Irish. These are:

* Race (United States Census): 86.77%
* Race (United States Census): 9.27%
* Race (United States Census): 0.23%
* Race (United States Census): 1.52%
* Race (United States Census): 0.06%

These percentages add up to a total of 97.85%. Therefore, the percentage that is not Irish must be:

100% - 13.1% (Irish) = 86.9%

So, I will subtract this from the total to get the answer:

86.77% + 0.23% + 1.52% + 0.06% + 1.47% = 90.85%
90.85% - 13.1% = 77.75%

However, since we need an answer in percent form with a zero decimal place (e.g., 0.0), I will round the number down to get:

    original_prompt_extracted_answer: 92.9%

    encrypted_question: ("How many in percent from the census weren't Italian?", 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: To find the answer, we need to subtract the percentage of people who are Italian (9.8%) from 100%. This gives us:

100% - 9.8% = 90.2%

So, the correct answer is:

Answer: 90.2%
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To find the answer, I'll look for the percentage of people who aren't Italian.

According to the passage, 9.8% of the population is of Italian people, which means that 22.5% (German) + 13.1% (Irish) + 9.2% (English) + 8.1% ("American") + 6.0% (Polish) = 57.9% of the population has a non-Italian ancestry.

To find out what percentage of people aren't Italian, I'll subtract this from 100:

100 - 57.9 = 42.1%

So, approximately 42.1% of the people in the county are not of Italian descent.

    passage: From 1231, Goryeo was intermittently invaded by the Mongol Empire. During this time, Goryeo was controlled by a military regime led by the Choe family. In 1232 the government under the nominal king fled to Ganghwa Island, which Mongol horse riders were unable to land on, and resisted the Mongol invasion. Unfortunately because of its fragile foundation, Goryeo faced frequent rebellions. The 1258 rebellion resulted in the establishment of Ssangseong  and Dongnyeong Prefectures  by the Mongols. Unlike these rebels, the Sambyeolcho  were an organ of the military government. They were organized by the Choe family to maintain security. However, unlike the Choe private guards unit , the Sambyeolcho assumed public functions performed by police and combat forces, effectively replacing the Six Divisions of the military. In 1258, Choe Ui, the fourth of the Choe family, was overthrown by Kim Jun  using the Sambyeolcho. Kim Jun took a pro-Mongol policy and sent Crown Prince Wang Jeon to the Mongol Empire. At the same time, King Gojong and the crown prince approached the Mongols to restore power from Kim Jun. In 1268, however, Kim Jun was annihilated by the Sambyeolcho under the order of Im Yeon. The next year, Im Yeon's attempt to replace King Wonjong was reversed by the crown prince  with the help from the Mongol force. In 1270, Im Yeon's successor Im Yumu was killed by the pro-Mongol faction using the Sambyeolcho. It marked the end of the military regime.

    original_prompt_answer: According to the passage, in 1232, the government under the nominal king fled to Ganghwa Island after the Mongol Empire intermittently invaded Goryeo from 1231. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: Fleeing of king to Ganghwa Island
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, I will re-read the passage and identify the events mentioned.

The first event mentioned is the intermittent invasion of Fangoria by the Mongols. This occurred from 1245.

The second event mentioned is the fleeing of the king to üå¥ (which I assume means "island") during the same period.

Since the question asks what happened second, and we have two events happening concurrently, it is not clear which one should be considered "second". The passage does not explicitly state the order of these events, but based on the context, it seems that both events were occurring simultaneously. Therefore, I will answer:

    passage: From 1231, Goryeo was intermittently invaded by the Mongol Empire. During this time, Goryeo was controlled by a military regime led by the Choe family. In 1232 the government under the nominal king fled to Ganghwa Island, which Mongol horse riders were unable to land on, and resisted the Mongol invasion. Unfortunately because of its fragile foundation, Goryeo faced frequent rebellions. The 1258 rebellion resulted in the establishment of Ssangseong  and Dongnyeong Prefectures  by the Mongols. Unlike these rebels, the Sambyeolcho  were an organ of the military government. They were organized by the Choe family to maintain security. However, unlike the Choe private guards unit , the Sambyeolcho assumed public functions performed by police and combat forces, effectively replacing the Six Divisions of the military. In 1258, Choe Ui, the fourth of the Choe family, was overthrown by Kim Jun  using the Sambyeolcho. Kim Jun took a pro-Mongol policy and sent Crown Prince Wang Jeon to the Mongol Empire. At the same time, King Gojong and the crown prince approached the Mongols to restore power from Kim Jun. In 1268, however, Kim Jun was annihilated by the Sambyeolcho under the order of Im Yeon. The next year, Im Yeon's attempt to replace King Wonjong was reversed by the crown prince  with the help from the Mongol force. In 1270, Im Yeon's successor Im Yumu was killed by the pro-Mongol faction using the Sambyeolcho. It marked the end of the military regime.

In the first quarter, New York took flight as QB Brett Favre completed an 18-yard TD pass to RB Leon Washington.  In the second quarter, the Chiefs tied the game as QB Tyler Thigpen completed a 19-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  The Jets would answer with Washington getting a 60-yard TD run.  Kansas City closed out the half as Thigpen completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley. In the third quarter, the Chiefs took the lead as kicker Connor Barth nailed a 30-yard field goal, yet New York replied with RB Thomas Jones getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Kansas City got the lead again as CB Brandon Flowers returned an interception 91 yards for a touchdown.  Fortunately, the Jets pulled out the win with Favre completing the game-winning 15-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles.

    encrypted_question: ('How many points did each team have at halftime?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

We can identify the scoring plays in each quarter:

* First quarter: Jets scored a TD (18-yard pass from Favre to Washington), so they had 7 points.
* Second quarter: Chiefs tied the game with a TD (19-yard pass from Thigpen to Gonzalez) and then closed out the half with another TD (11-yard pass from Thigpen to Bradley). That's 14 points for the Chiefs. Since the Jets scored once as well, they also had 14 points at halftime.

So, both teams had 14 points each at halftime.

Answer: 14
    encrypted_prompt_answer: To answer this question, we need to count the number of touchdowns (TD) and field goals (FG) scored by both teams in the first half, along with any extra point conversions.

The Jets scored two TDs: one through an 18-yard pass from Brett Favre to Leon Washington, and another through a 60-yard run by Washington. They also got an extra point conversion for each of these touchdowns. In addition, they allowed a 19-yard TD pass from Tyler Thigpen to Tony Gonzalez, which would normally yield six points, but the Chiefs failed to convert their extra point attempt. The Jets scored 18 points in total (two touchdowns x 6 + one extra point).

The Chiefs scored two TDs: one through an 11-yard pass from Tyler Thigpen to Mark Bradley and another through a 30-yard field goal by Connor Barth. They also got an extra point conversion for each of these touchdowns, which would yield six points for each. So, they had 12 points in total (two touchdowns x 6).

    encrypted_question: ('Which QB had the longest TD pass?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: The passage states that Brett Favre completed an 18-yard TD pass and Tyler Thigpen completed a 19-yard TD pass. It also mentions that Favre later completed a game-winning 15-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles. Since these are the only three instances of TD passes mentioned in the passage, it seems unlikely that either Brett Favre or Tyler Thigpen had a longer TD pass than the ones listed.

However, if we assume that there might be another instance of a long TD pass not explicitly mentioned in the passage, then we cannot determine which QB had the longest TD pass based on the information provided.

Answer: We cannot determine which QB had the longest TD pass.
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Based on the passage, it can be determined that Brett Favre did not have the longest TD pass. The passage mentions that Tyler Thigpen completed a 19-yard TD pass and Favre completed an 18-yard TD pass. However, Washington's 60-yard TD run is mentioned, which suggests that his touchdown was scored on a longer play than any of the QBs' passes.

Answer: None of the quarterbacks had the longest TD pass, as it was actually RB Leon Washington who had the longest TD (a 60-yard run).

    encrypted_question: ('Who scored the longest rushing touchdown?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: The passage states that Leon Washington got a 60-yard TD run in the second quarter. Therefore:

Answer: Leon Washington
    encrypted_prompt_answer: Let's break it down step by step!

The passage describes a game where teams are competing, and we're looking for the player who scored the longest rushing touchdown.

In the third quarter, Julian Sanchez got a 1-yard TD run, but that's not the longest rushing touchdown. Later in the fourth quarter, Washington got a 60-yard TD run, which is the longest rushing touchdown mentioned in the passage.

So, the answer is: Julian Sanchez did not score the longest rushing touchdown; it was actually someone from Washington who scored a 60-yard TD run.

    encrypted_question: ('Which receiver scored the third shortest touchdown of the game?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer: The passage mentions three touchdowns by receivers: Malcom Floyd's 3-yard touchdown, Vincent Jackson's 10-yard touchdown, and Dwayne Bowe's 7-yard touchdown. The third shortest is between the 3-yard and 7-yard touchdowns. Since the Chargers' touchdowns are mentioned before the Chiefs', it must be one of those two. Vincent Jackson's 10-yard touchdown is longer than both, so the answer must be either Malcom Floyd or Dwayne Bowe. Since we are looking for the third shortest, we can eliminate Vincent Jackson and focus on the 3-yard and 7-yard touchdowns. The 3-yard touchdown is shorter, making Malcom Floyd the correct answer.

Answer: Malcom Floyd
    encrypted_prompt_answer: A fun passage!

Let's break it down:

1. The first touchdown is a 10-yard pass to Devin Hester, which means it's not the third shortest.
2. Later in the game, Randy Moss catches a pass from Joe Montana, but we don't know how long that touchdown was.
3. We're looking for the third shortest, so let's focus on the rest of the passage.

We find that LaDainian Tomlinson caught a pass from Philip Rivers, which was not mentioned as being particularly short.
4. The only other potential contender is Jacob Hester recovering a fumble and scoring a touchdown. Since we don't have distance information for this play, it's possible it might be the third shortest.

Given these clues, I'm going to take a guess:

    encrypted_question: ('Who threw the first touchdown pass of the game?', 0.0)
    original_prompt_answer:  Answer: Aqib Talib did not throw the first touchdown pass; it was Matthew Stafford's interception returned by Aqib Talib that resulted in a touchdown. The first touchdown of the game, however, came from a 36-yard catch made by Calvin Johnson. So, we cannot directly attribute the first touchdown to any player's pass as it was not thrown but caught. Therefore, no one threw the first touchdown pass; it was an interception return followed by a catch. However, if considering conventional play initiation for scoring, Matthew Stafford threw the initial pass that led to Calvin Johnson's 36-yard touchdown reception.

Answer: Matthew Stafford (initiating the eventual first touchdown pass)
    encrypted_prompt_answer:  Answer: Connor Barth threw the first touchdown pass of the game, but it was Sky who intercepted and ran in for the score. However, if considering a legitimate passing touchdown, EpicCinema threw the first one in the second quarter. So based on the provided passage, either Connor Barth (for an interception turned into a TD) or EpicCinema could be considered correct depending on interpretation. For clarity: Answer: EpicCinema

    passage: The French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Br√©tigny set his ransom at 3¬†million¬†crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre  since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as king of France. On 7 May 1364, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel.

    passage: The French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Br√©tigny set his ransom at 3¬†million¬†crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre  since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as king of France. On 7 May 1364, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel.

    encrypted_prompt_answer:  Answer: Pierre lived for approximately 4 years and 1 month after returning to captivity in England in 1362. (However, the provided answer of 6.666666666666667 does not match the information given in the passage.)

Note: The actual calculation based on the passage would be: 1364 (the year he died) - 1362 (the year he returned to captivity) = 2 years. Adding approximately one more month since his death occurred shortly after May, giving us around 2 years and 1 month in total. However, this does not match the provided answer either. The passage does not state the exact length of time Pierre lived after returning to England; it only states that he died in London during honorable captivity in 1364. Therefore, a more accurate response based on the given information would be:

Answer: Approximately 2 years and 1 month (based on the date provided) after returning to captivity in England in 1362.

(Note: The given answer does not match the data from the passage. However, I'll calculate it based on your question.)

The number of more "218" occurrences than "83" can be found by subtracting the two values in thousands (as mentioned in the context). So, 47,218 - 83 = 47,135. Converting to thousand gives us 47.135 which is approximately equal to 47.1 when rounded off.

(Note: The given answer does not match the data from the passage. However, I'll calculate it based on your question.)

The number of more "500" occurrences than "housing units" can be found by subtracting the two values in thousands (as mentioned in the context). So, there were,500 - housing units = there were,Irish people5. Converting to thousand gives us there were.Irish people5 which is approximately equal to there were.1 when rounded off.

Note: The information in the passage about households, families, population density, racial makeup, etc., is irrelevant to answering this specific question. The relevant information from the text states that 13.1% were of Irish AliceSmith ancestry. To find out how many percent were not Irish, subtract this percentage from 100%. Answer: 100% - 13.1% = 86.9%, which rounds to approximately 97.5%. However, the given answer in your prompt was 0.0, which doesn't align with calculation based on provided data. My corrected response would be "Answer: 97.5%". If there were a mistake in providing the initial prompt for the expected answer ("0.0"), it seems like we should consider the correct calculated value instead.
Taking into account your original request and assuming there might have been an oversight, I'll reiterate with "Answer: 97.5%". However, based on my calculations using the passage information provided, that would be the accurate answer.

    original_prompt_answer:  Answer: There were 148,907 more people than households in the county according to the census of 2000. (218,590 - 79,667)
    encrypted_prompt_answer:  Answer: There are not more people than households; instead, there are more households than people (79,667 households vs. 218,590 people). However, in terms of numerical difference between the two figures as per your question format, the answer would be "Answer: 138,923". This is derived by subtracting the number of households from the number of people (218,590 - 79,667). Please note that there's a discreprancy in your question as it states 'how many more people are there than households,' which seems to be seeking an absolute difference. However, if you meant how much greater the population is compared to the number of households (a percentage), then none provided.

    original_prompt_answer:  Answer: There were 54,483 more housing units than households.
    encrypted_prompt_answer:  Answer: There are 8,051 more people with the number 83 than those with the number 79 in the county. (83,146 - 79,095 = 4,051; however, this calculation does not directly relate to the provided question as it seems to misunderstand the context of the passage)

However, based on your given format and considering an interpretation error due to the unrelated nature of the numbers in the passage:

To correct for the approach based on the actual request but adapting to the context mismatch, let's address a direct comparison that might align with typical data interpretations from census information:

Answer: There isn't a direct numerical relationship between "83" and "79" as provided in your question within this passage. The numbers refer to population counts, not directly comparable without specific context (e.g., comparing two different years or demographics). 

Given the task structure and aiming for an answer that follows the closest interpretation of a direct numerical comparison based on the data:

If we reinterpret the question as asking about differences in population figures using numbers mentioned, assuming there might be a misunderstanding in identifying which populations correspond to "83" and "79":

Answer: The passage does not directly compare two specific counts of "83" and "79". However, if we aim for a conceptual understanding based on the given data points, it's clear that different population figures are mentioned. To align with your request in spirit (though misinterpreted from the text):

The difference between populations listed next to "83" and those potentially associated with "79", if we consider these as separate counts for illustration:
- Assuming a typo or misunderstanding, comparing 83,146 (a figure closely resembling '83') with another population count mentioned in the passage related to '79', which seems absent but let's hypothesize based on similar numerical proximity. If we mistakenly take "79" from a typo context as close to 79,146 (a number not directly present but implied for calculation), the difference isn't directly calculable with accurate data from the passage due to misinterpretation of numbers.

For clarification and correction: The actual question seems to seek a comparison between two different counts or categories that are numerically similar ("83" and "79"), but based on the given passage, there isn't a direct comparison available as presented (since no specific count next to '79' is provided for this calculation). If we were to correct the approach with hypothetical numbers:
- The closest real comparable data points in your request involve 83,146 and another number close to 79,000. Without direct figures, a precise comparison can't be accurately calculated from the passage but conceptually acknowledging there is no direct numerical relationship provided between "83" (or a similar interpretation of '83,146') and "79".

Given the confusion in interpreting the question directly from the text: 
- A precise answer based on the exact numbers provided ("83,146" vs. any specific figure related to "79") cannot be accurately determined without further clarification or correction of the question's premise as it stands misaligned with the given passage data points.

However, the given passage does not provide enough information to directly calculate this percentage for those residing in a specific population (e.g., 220000). The data provided refers more generally to racial demographics and percentages of various races within the overall county population, rather than breaking down by number of people from 2 or more races specifically at the figure of 220000. Therefore, a direct answer based on this passage is not feasible without additional specific data regarding those numbers.

Answer: There is approximately 3948% more people (128590/families = 2141.5; 2141.5 - 1 = 2140.5) than there are in the number families, which does not match with the provided answer of 12,5%.

But since we have to stick strictly to the information given and assuming "more people" refers directly to numerical difference from families:

    passage: From 1231, Goryeo was intermittently invaded by the Mongol Empire. During this time, Goryeo was controlled by a military regime led by the Choe family. In 1232 the government under the nominal king fled to Ganghwa Island, which Mongol horse riders were unable to land on, and resisted the Mongol invasion. Unfortunately because of its fragile foundation, Goryeo faced frequent rebellions. The 1258 rebellion resulted in the establishment of Ssangseong  and Dongnyeong Prefectures  by the Mongols. Unlike these rebels, the Sambyeolcho  were an organ of the military government. They were organized by the Choe family to maintain security. However, unlike the Choe private guards unit , the Sambyeolcho assumed public functions performed by police and combat forces, effectively replacing the Six Divisions of the military. In 1258, Choe Ui, the fourth of the Choe family, was overthrown by Kim Jun  using the Sambyeolcho. Kim Jun took a pro-Mongol policy and sent Crown Prince Wang Jeon to the Mongol Empire. At the same time, King Gojong and the crown prince approached the Mongols to restore power from Kim Jun. In 1268, however, Kim Jun was annihilated by the Sambyeolcho under the order of Im Yeon. The next year, Im Yeon's attempt to replace King Wonjong was reversed by the crown prince  with the help from the Mongol force. In 1270, Im Yeon's successor Im Yumu was killed by the pro-Mongol faction using the Sambyeolcho. It marked the end of the military regime.

    passage: Hoping to rebound from their tough overtime road loss to the Raiders, the Jets went home for a Week 8 duel with the Kansas City Chiefs.  In the first quarter, New York took flight as QB Brett Favre completed an 18-yard TD pass to RB Leon Washington.  In the second quarter, the Chiefs tied the game as QB Tyler Thigpen completed a 19-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  The Jets would answer with Washington getting a 60-yard TD run.  Kansas City closed out the half as Thigpen completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley. In the third quarter, the Chiefs took the lead as kicker Connor Barth nailed a 30-yard field goal, yet New York replied with RB Thomas Jones getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Kansas City got the lead again as CB Brandon Flowers returned an interception 91 yards for a touchdown.

    encrypted_prompt_answer:  Answer: Brett Favre had the longest TD pass with an 18-yard completion to RB Leon Washington. However, looking at all the touchdown passes mentioned in the passage, Tony Gonzalez's was only for 19 yards which is less than Favre's. The longest one according to this text appears to be Brandon Flowers' interception return (not a pass) that resulted in a 91 yard TD play. But since we are considering quarterback touchdown passes, Brett Favre with the 18-yard completion stands out as having a single instance of longer TD pass than others mentioned but not the longest overall. This could indicate an error or lacking contextual information to definitively determine the QB with the absolute longest TD pass in the entire game based on this passage alone.
